["play it to the bone is a punch - drunk mess of a movie . containing a good cast but awful acting ; an interesting premise but terrible execution , ron shelton ( white men can ' t jump ) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two . rocky no . 1 is vince boudreau ( woody harrelson , edtv ) , a bald , tattooed , newly converted christian , whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word . . . something that he has not yet successfully achieved . rocky no . 2 is caesar dominguez ( antonio banderas , the 13th warrior ) , best friend of vince who is currently dating vince ' s ex - girlfriend , grace . both men are nearing the end of their \" almost \" careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity . when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated , the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement . our boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is \" promised \" a shot at a future title fight . the film is divided into two sections . at first , we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes , in grace ' s \" sassy grassy \" green muscle car , travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day . along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by . once in vegas , the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar . both mr . harrelson and mr . banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past , not that we ' d know it from their work here . mr . harrelson is uncomfortably awkward , apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince . the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable . mr . banderas is uncharacteristically non - charismatic as caesar . weak and ineffectual , there is little life in his screen performance . the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another . tom sizemore ( saving private ryan ) , robert wagner ( austin powers ii : the spy who shagged me ) , and richard masur ( fire down below ) are crooked promoters , lucy liu ( payback ) is a sex - starved hitchhiker looking for a good time , and lolita davidovich ( gods and monsters ) , is the shared girlfriend who can ' t make her mind up which boxer she prefers . because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them , the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins . but even then , because the outcome is so predictably obvious , the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other . writer / director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed , well - choreographed , well - edited , and well - performed . if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film . as it is , the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable . the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film . the phrase , \" play it to the bone ' is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you ' ve achieved your desired goal . that is a biblical principle . \" know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? so run , that ye may obtain . \" 1 corinthians 9 : 24 [ kjv ] achieving anything worthy in life requires \" playing it to the bone \" . we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives . this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives . as a movie , play it to the bone is hardly worth our time . but as a principle of life , the phrase \" play it to the bone \" are words to live by .", "titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it ' s upsetting that it isn ' t . the film , which cost $ 200 million + to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it ' sunk ' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film . we all know that big budget dosen ' t mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic . but sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron ' s best films ) the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic . they find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman . the woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her . the explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic . in the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america . also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen ' t love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich . she nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them . oh yeah , and the ship sinks . and that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius . the story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak . the story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck - up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in - jokes of how the boat won ' t sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it ' s a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film . without good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear . firstly , there ' s cameron ' s direction . there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic . but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end . there is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron . it ' s a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below . thanks to cameron ' s direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes . to support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters . dicaprio is good , although he only looks 16 - 17 years old . his performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines . winslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth . zane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash . the audience really does come to hate him . he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he ' s in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well . also worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american . finally , the icing on the ' great things ' cake are the special effects . cameron is a whiz with effects ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and they are used very well throughout . the sweeps of the ships are awesome , although digital domain , who did the effects , cannot animate human movement too well . the humans seem to move to ' smoothly ' , there ' s just something odd about them . you can tell that they have been animated on a computer . of course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed . titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film . titanic , then , is a wonder of directing , acting and cgi , but not writing and story . again , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts . titanic , then , although not the godfather of movies it could of been , is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius . enjoyable , scary , and even sad , titanic is a film cinema was invented for , filling the screen with incredible images , and assaulting the ears with awesome sound . a superb film , but sadly not perfect . overall rating = (", "this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset : the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st . elsewhere for several years , and i had understood that the director / screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also . i am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations , nor were they satisfactory . if i had to list a reason why . . . . but that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides , it ' s not immediately clear , as there are so many problems with the film . adam arkin plays a grade - school teacher who is sardonic , cynical , and somewhat abrasive , but a good teacher . he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court . one day , he meets a drifter ( david morse , who plays jack morrison on st . elsewhere ) in the park , and inveigles him in a game of one - on - one basketball . morse turns out to be good , and a friendship slowly develops between the two , as their respective professions progress on the screen -- arkin ' s teaching , and morse ' s selling of paper flowers to passing motorists . so far , my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue , and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack . good music to be sure , but it doesn ' t replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story -- it makes the film somewhat minimalistic , a technique i rarely admire . suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse ' s introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin ' s , a woman arkin has long admired from afar , but it too reticent to approach . it appears that she begins to admire morse ( who enjoys here attentions , but isn ' t sure what to do about it -- she doesn ' t realize that he is a drifter , and knows nothing about his past ) , and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else . until then , i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film . the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full - fledged failure . the woman , at least to me , appeared to be fairly shallow ; i didn ' t realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin , where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse . somehow , this is made to appear as if it is arkin ' s fault , and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he ' s gotten such a find of girlfriend . frankly , dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make ; punching her in the mouth not the least . after this , the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural . if i had to summarize a major gripe , it ' s that this is a story spread too thin , that creates semi - likable characters at the outset , and then suddenly jerks them into being 16 - year - olds at the last moment . it might be true - to - life with some people ; but that doesn ' t mean * i * have to like it . i don ' t . . avoid .", "with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different . its structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . the parallels don ' t end there , either . atlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big - screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king ' s dreamcatcher . even the film ' s content is a bit reminiscent of mile . in fact , it ' s the perfect blend of the feel - good ' 60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . king ' s atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film ' s title comes from the second chapter ) . it ' s set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11 - year - old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self - centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould ' s secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son . bobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich . when a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby ' s mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror . ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers . i won ' t go into what these powers are , but they ' re considerably toned down from the book ( and don ' t involve black stuff flying out of ted ' s mouth , a la mile ) . atlantis ' present - day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel ' s final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle - aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years . atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks ' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar - nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski ' s red . the acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . lecter . most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider . while i didn ' t really have much of a problem with goldman ' s screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . goldman , for those of you who don ' t read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else ' s films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he ' s penned ( like the general ' s daughter ) . it ' s mean - spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o . j . and robert blake ) . in atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back . well , he ' s not , and it doesn ' t make sense . 1 : 41 - pg - 13 for violence and thematic elements", "because no one demanded it : david duchovny in a romantic comedy ! at last , both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources ! the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot , which could be fodder for a valentine ' s day episode of \" the x - files . \" bob rueland ( david duchovny ) loses his wife elizabeth ( joely richardson ) in a car accident . at the same time , grace briggs ( minnie driver ) is in the hospital , waiting for a heart transplant . grace gets elizabeth ' s heart , and it leads her to bob . it ' s the romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer and then is driven to slaughter people . four writers are credited with contributing to the story . that doesn ' t seem possible . despite being a solid two hours long , \" return to me \" adds little to the \" boy meets girl / boy loses girl \" formula and , as a result , is terribly tedious and slow - moving . duchovny and driver seem unable to generate any sparks , and i kept wishing for a fast - forward button to move their scenes along . since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before , i blame duchovny . he ' s out of his element without the manufactured and static sexual tension of his tv series ( and i ' ve always thought that the relationship between mulder and scully on \" the x - files \" comes off more sibling - like than hot - and - bothered ) . there ' s something about duchovny that makes me uneasy . regardless of the role he ' s playing , he comes off as a weirdo . the only redeeming quality of \" return to me \" is its hilarious supporting cast . the circle of friends and relatives around bob and grace is constantly playing matchmaker , and they generate the only laughs in the movie . carroll o ' connor is grace ' s grandfather marty o ' reilly . when bob comes into marty ' s restaurant after hours , marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status . when marty discovers that bob is a widower , he invites bob to join his poker game and introduces him with the declaration , \" this is bob ! his wife is dead ! \" the poker buddies are just as desperate to find a mate for grace and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news . also funny : bonnie hunt as grace ' s best friend megan and james belushi as megan ' s husband joe . married with children , megan and joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance . although it ' s rare to see him in a movie that premieres in a theater , belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill . rounding out the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob ' s best friend and robert loggia as marty ' s brother - in - law angelo . in only the lead actors lived up to the standards set by the rest of the cast . bottom line : if you are compelled to see this movie , watch it on video so you can fast - forward to scenes with carroll o ' connor and james belushi .", "\" be gentle , \" urges natasha henstridge to matthew perry in \" the whole nine yards . \" \" i haven ' t made love in five years . \" \" neither have i , \" rebuts perry . \" i ' m married ! \" if jonathan lynn ' s latest comedy relied simply on jokes of that caliber -- and it certainly tries -- then it ' d be an innocuous if rather obvious little film . instead , its failings go much deeper . first off , who hasn ' t had enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy genre ? if you want to make a pretty penny or two in hollywood nowadays simply write a \" comedy \" which pairs a robert de niro / james caan / bruce willis type with a billy crystal / hugh grant / matthew perry type and wait for the royalties to roll in . who ' s next ? jack nicholson and martin short ? it certainly doesn ' t have to be funny . \" the whole nine yards \" is not a particularly funny film , but it is borderline offensive . offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldn ' t think twice about pushing your mother - in - law off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete . that might sound like a funny sight gag , but the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fact that taking a human life isn ' t all that funny to begin with . when the corpse is placed in a car , doused with gasoline , set ablaze and referred to as \" barbecue , \" it makes you wonder when all this playing killing for laughs is going to end . \" the whole nine yards \" is also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects . rosanna arquette plays a slutty , chain - smoking french canadian who ' s married to matthew perry ' s none - too - successful dentist . it ' s an unflattering role made all the more so by the unflattering outfits -- and unflattering situations -- into which arquette is thrust . then there ' s natasha henstridge ( \" species \" i and ii ) who plays the well - to - do wife of contract killer bruce willis . she gets involved with perry ' s character when he comes to chicago hoping to negotiate a finder ' s fee with mob boss yanni gogolack ( kevin pollack , transposing his vs with his ws ) after willis ' jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next door . henstridge and perry ' s characters hitting it off is about as likely as bruce and demi getting back together . perry might have the charm but he doesn ' t have the physical attributes of a traditional leading man , especially in close - up . most objectified of the bunch is amanda peet , who turns in a sexually - ripe performance as perry ' s dental assistant with , it transpires , questionable career goals . peet ' s gratuitous nude scene proves how low this movie will stoop to keep its audience from dropping off . when \" my cousin vinny \" is the highpoint of a directorial career including such forgettable films as \" clue , \" \" greedy , \" and \" sgt . bilko , \" you have to wonder if lynn chose the wrong career path . perry ' s pratfalling goofiness coupled with willis ' likable hardness could have had some potential but with no script to work with , and a director who seems to be watching from the wings , their characters run out of gas quickly .", "one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean - luc godard film . after all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave . he is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing . however , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year . the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation . these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly . it is edgar ' s ( bruno putzulu ) self - appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : \" it ' s only when things are over that they make sense . \" whether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided . the thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone . instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last . only once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you ' re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it . but don ' t fret , it will surface again . you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile . but you hold hope for some time . the background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations . it ' s only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope . and with speeches like , \" i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , \" how can you expect to hold anyone ' s interest ? to godard ' s credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene . the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful . watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him . and if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities . the environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them . unfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene . sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words . the second half is composed of nauseating hyper - color that often blurs the image . you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners . the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies . steven spielberg is picked on in particular . while i ' ll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it ' s still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood . it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn ' t necessarily an admirable storyteller . the days of breathless are no more .", "the thirteenth floor , the third in what i would call \" the reality check movie series \" , is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year , the matrix and existenz . all three made you think , made you wonder what is real , what isn ' t , and if our world is just a huge game . the thirteenth floor doesn ' t reach the level of originality , creativity , and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz , but it certainly gives a great shot at it . in the matrix , we were told that the humans are simply a virus . in existenz , we learned that our life could be just a game . in the thirteenth floor , we learn that we are just electronic devices , living under another world of electronic devices . there is just one world on top of another , and everything in them are fake and electronically generated . the thirteenth floor took a huge , risky turn that i didn ' t expect it to take , and i ' m not very sure it was such a great turn to make . rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film , the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds . after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller , played by armin mueller - stahl , douglas hall , played by craig bierko , a man that worked under fuller for many years , must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using , to the year 1937 , which consists of computer generated characters only . the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days . all of the people involved are just characters , or are they ? douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours , and killed fuller . along the way , douglas interacts with many different potential suspects , and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller , jane fuller , played wonderfully by a talented young actress , gretchen mol . the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going , and doesn ' t use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer ' s interests . i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz , and i wouldn ' t enjoy it , but there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film . unfortunately , many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content , letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened . the scenes that aren ' t original or interesting seem to go absolutely nowhere , leaving you wondering , \" what is the point of this ? \" sometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true . i know this isn ' t a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is . on the plus side of acting , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller - stahl . in the thirteenth floor , he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances . another plus is gretchen mol ' s realistic performance , creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one - dimensional phase . don ' t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor , just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile , and shuts you down like any other movie would . thrills , chills , and spills aren ' t what you will get in this film , but you will just get another trip to send your mind on , scrambling it until you ' ve had enough . the bottom line - let ' s hope this is the last of the \" reality check \" based movies for awhile .", "\" return to horror high , \" wants to be a couple different types of movies at once . the film tells the story of a low - budget horror movie being filmed at the closed - down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before . but what the cast and crew don ' t know is that a real killer , maybe the same one that was never apprehended , is going into action again . on one level , \" return to horror high \" is a slasher movie , and it is at this level that it works the best on . watching the film , which was made in 1987 , i couldn ' t help but take notice that the killer ' s costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in , \" scream , \" and \" scream 2 . \" on another level , the film wants to be a slapstick comedy , and there are many hints of this throughout . unfortunately , most of these jokes fall flat . and the last thing the film wants to be is a \" behind - the - scenes \" look at an exploitation film being made . the only problem is that , while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made , no cameras are shown filming it , thus making it far more confusing than it had to be . and to top it all off , the \" twist \" ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever , and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time . there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous , and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through . if you see the film , or have seen it , you ' ll know what i mean . the premise of \" return to horror high , \" is admittedly pretty crafty , and i liked the atmosphere of the school , which is where the whole thing takes place . but director froehlich , judging from this movie , is an incompetent director , except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene . well , come to think of it , there is only one scene that is actually scary , and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in . but other than that two - minute distraction , \" return to horror high , \" is certainly no great shake . note : look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film . and strangely enough , he is the first character to get the ax . . . literally .", "one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o ' donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton ' s 1925 silent film seven chances . now i ' ve never seen seven chances , as i ' m more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this . o ' donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company . he also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he ' s unwilling to marry her . his reasons ? well he ' s a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don ' t like to be roped or something ( hey , that ' s the movie ' s explanation . . . i ' d marry renee zellweger in a second ) . eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it ' s the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever . he essentially says to her , \" you win \" and hands her a ring . the audience should now hate this character . i did . then the meat of the plot presents itself . jimmie ' s grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business . however , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) . having blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a \" business proposition \" . the movie wasn ' t half bad by this time , surprisingly . it wasn ' t boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point . ustinov ' s character left a video will , and while he ' s reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself \" what is this , brewster ' s millions ? \" . as soon as i thought it , hal holbrook ' s character actually says \" what is this , brewster ' s millions ? \" it was quite surreal . something happens though during the film ' s final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive . up to that point , all of jimmie ' s prior girlfriends had turned down his \" business proposition \" which i felt was good . at least the film wasn ' t painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers . when jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story . at this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride . these women arrive at jimmie ' s location and immediately start bullying him about what he ' s looking for in a woman . when he ' s had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there ' s been a mistake and he won ' t be marrying any of them . as a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off . this goes on for the rest of the film . it ' s just chris o ' donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women . my groans of disgust could be heard for miles . the film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day i ' m still groaning . the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video . it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd - rom features . the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film . apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o ' donnell around the city , and at one point o ' donnell is leaping from the tops of buses . so that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ? ugh .", "at the outset of swordfish , john travolta ' s gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today . basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers . how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . swordfish is loud , violent and amoral . it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . and how does travolta ' s gabriel plan to do this ? by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out - terrorize terrorists . swordfish is a very cynical movie . it relies on an audience ' s perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non - human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . the movie ' s plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you ' d actually see how ridiculous it all is . this is a live - action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it ' s over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government ' s computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti - terrorist campaign . talk about whacked - out patriotism . my objections to swordfish are many . the body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort . it ' s becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits . another example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10 - year - old daughter and his ex - wife . stanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband ' s adult films . thus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . in fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel ' s henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley ' s daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films . there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on - screen victims as well . yea , it ' s only make believe , but that doesn ' t mean you have to tolerate it . travolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near - crazy gabriel . his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face / off . jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings . his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database . his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate . halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel ' s assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel . swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger - than - life character in gabriel . viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain . and maybe that is the movie ' s underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive . and that is not enough . this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water .", "cradle will rock is the latest effort from director / actor tim robbins . while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 ( dead man walking ) , he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here . the story is confusing , and filled with many subplots , so i ' ll try my best and explain it as simply as possible . the film is based on a \" mostly \" true story about a federal theater in the 1930s , that produced a play ( the cradle will rock ) that apparently was offensive to some , so the government shuts it down . it ' s during the time of the depression , and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs , or are poor . between this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots , about those who work in theater , or those associated . also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience . tim robbin ' s just keeps piling on political views , and characters , that we just give up on the film , or in some cases walk out . for robbin ' s it may be a nice achievement , but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue , and fancy outfits . i thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast , unfortunately are all uninteresting , except for a few . let me recap what each important character does , so please bear with me ( it ' s the least you can do , especially if you were considering seeing this ) . i ' ll begin with those involved with the play . there ' s orson welles ( angus macfadyen ) who of course is the director of the play , the producer john houseman ( cary elwes ) , marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) the writer of the play , emily watson , a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock . outside the play there ' s the : ventriloquist ( bill murray ) who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk ( joan cusack ) , another subplot involving a painter diego rivera ( ruben blades ) who ' s unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage ( john cusack ) . there ' s a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories ( susan sarandon , philip baker hall too name a few ) but those that i mentioned , were the most significant to the story . anyway , most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted , except for emily watson , who does another great job , and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack , who always delivers through thick and thin . now although most of the film was weak to say the least , there were some nice moments and some involving subjects , but all this is overblown . sure the free speech segment was a nice feature , but not when it becomes repetitive . the whole film is like this , and it ' s basically nothing but a headache . on the brighter side , tim robbin ' s direction was masterful . his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson ' s latest magnolia , only smoother in my opinion , but even that can ' t make a movie that much better . although it has it ' s moments ( not many of them , but they ' re there ) , cradle will rock stays true to it ' s title , because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over .", "robin hood : men in tights is another mel - brooks - produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein . mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit . unfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world . it is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce . the plot borrows heavily from the well - received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves . this is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie . mel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on . the movie ' s scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice . cary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard . he escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis . he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil \" sheriff of rottingham \" . a good adventure plot that is sadly unused . elwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating . neither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren ' t funny , nor believable . perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone . this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre . much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre . chuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from \" rent - a - wreck \" ) then from any dialogue whatsoever . scenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting . perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive . the basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny . mel brooks as a circumcision - giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) . the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails . the addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive . the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard . he is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting . if you can ' t , don ' t even bother watching this miserable film .", "plot : something about a bunch of kids going into a haunted house and playing out parodies of other horror and non -

minutes worth of fart jokes , half - assed stunts and spoofs of films other than horror . now i ' m not exactly sure if each of the writers wrote their own parts separately or just tossed \" funny sketch \" ideas out there while smoking the chronic themselves , but the end result is a film that basically plays out like an extended skit on \" saturday night live \" . there are a couple of funny one - liners , but mostly just rehashed one - joke scenes , a lot of dead silence and lame gags . add to that the very unoriginal title and movie poster and you gotta start asking yourself if anybody was even trying here ( the film ' s website isn ' t even up yet ! ! ! what the f * * * ? ! ? ) . i do however have to give it up to james woods , the man who opens up this movie with the funniest parody of them all ( the exorcist take - off -- miss this and you ' ve missed any reason to see the flick ) . i especially liked his one - liner as he walked in to see the possessed woman ' s head turning . very funny ! unfortunately , the film plummets straight down after that , with dumb parodies of many teen flicks that have nothing to do with horror such as save the last dance and dude , where ' s my car , and other action movies like charlie ' s angels and mission impossible 2 . now help me figure this one out , will you ? isn ' t this supposed to be a parody film of horror movies ? ! ? ( or maybe that ' s just the title of the film f - ing with my head ) . well , i ' m sorry to have to say this but the only horror in this film is its lame - ass script ! the wayans brothers should have known better than to look towards the weinstein brothers ( money ) instead of the zucker brothers ( comedy ) for this sequel . unfortunately for us , all we ' re left with here is a skeleton of a film which might ' ve been funny , had it been worked over a few more times , tightened up here and there , and been injected with more solid laughs . but as things stand now , there is no doubt in my mind that the obvious greed to capitalize on the success of last year ' s film has led everyone down this path , so screw them for not trying as hard ( critically speaking , of course ) . you should all be ashamed of yourselves for not putting enough \" real \" effort into this chop - job and for not providing your fans with the ultimate of your talents . pooh on you !

yup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc . fire flies from the sky , flesh - eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep ' s plan begins to unfold . ok , so it ' s not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough . the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz isn ' t half bad either . the action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror - loving folks as well . no , it ' s no phantom menace beater , but if you ' re looking for a solid warm - up to the summer movie season , you won ' t find a better film under wraps than the mummy . if this doesn ' t give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will .", "synopsis : easily - angered , chainsmoking architect david encounters his homicidal first wife diedre five years after their divorce . diedre easily cons david ' s not - so - bright new wife molly into believing she ' s a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and david ' s quick - tempered son , michael . diedre , at the same time , murders a bunch of people . comments : the ex is a very bad movie . i haven ' t seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while . i kept vacillating , however , between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor ( ultimately , i decided to split the difference and give it two stars ) . as summarized briefly in the synopsis , this is yet another spurned - psycho - lover - gets - her - revenge type movie . i ' m not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline , but it seems like 10 , 000 , 000 , 000 . the ex , however , though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre , differs slightly from the norm in that , at least , it doesn ' t take itself too seriously like so many other duds do ( malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind ) . those involved in the movie realize they ' re in a turkey , apparently , and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script . the ex ' s storyline , as i said , incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature ; however , the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable that , after a while , the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie . diedre , david ' s first wife , kills and kills and kills , for example , without ever having to worry about police investigations and the like ( it ' s not as though she ' s bright enough not to leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime ) . david and his new wife molly have an incredibly difficult time understanding why michael , their son , has emotional problems , specifically his inability to control his anger . though david smokes like tomorrow will never come and blows up at people every other minute in the movie , the connection between him and his son is not made . molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she ' s a child psychologist and allows the demented woman to spend time with her son . time and time again , things do not add up in this movie . if a viewer can ' t accept this fact , then he will definately not like the ex . if , on the other hand , he can appreciate the movie for its campiness , then he ' ll probably like it much better . i don ' t mean to necessarily suggest , however , that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp . even when viewed from an it ' s - so - bad - it ' s - good angle , this movie isn ' t all that successful . the ex does have its moments , though , almost all of which involve yancy butler ( the psychotic diedre ) and nick mancuso ( david ) . these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which , oftentimes , elicit chuckles from the audience . the truly awful lines written for them help this humor along . butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue ; every time her character kills someone , she has a punchline that ' s unbelievably inane . when she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david , for example , diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar and states \" i ' m so sorry , your lease is terminated . \" or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene ? ( diedre ' s therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit diedre , alone , in her new apartment -- never realizing , of course , that it ' s not her ' s . therapists typically are catatonically brain - dead in these movies ) . having successfully snuffed the woman out , diedre looks at the body and says : \" what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session , dr . jones ? oh , that ' s right . ' i ' m sorry , but your time is up ! ' \" this is what passes for humor in the film . the audience doesn ' t necessarily laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience can ' t believe they ' re watching this crap -- although watching it they are ) . nick mancuso ' s chainsmoking , nervous - wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler ' s character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief . in between drags off his cigarette , for instance , in one of the movie ' s best scenes , david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex - wife is . in exaggerated exasperation , he nearly shouts \" the woman is a cuckoo - bird ! \" ( trust me , it is funny in context . ) and so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion . i won ' t reveal the ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review ) , but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film . molly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds ! molly , at one point in the film , not - so - brilliantly observes , after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family ' s to spy upon them , that \" she ' s crazy . \" you ' d be pretty crazy too if you ' d rented this turkey . i ' d avoid it unless it ' s on tv and you come across it . if you do , you may want to watch it , groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot , and feel good that you didn ' t spend money renting it .", "romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant . with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top - notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination . those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well - written screenplay . call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don ' t seem to mix well . gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife . his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn ' t provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character . jack has become addicted to \" feeding the hole \" , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money . when he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out . gary oldman ' s performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored . in the process , he also gets tangled - up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider . demarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world . this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2 . i can ' t remember seeing a character quite like her . after being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety . what a woman ! lena olin ' s performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film . anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo ' s wife . there is little insight into her character . she ' s depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house . juliette lewis , as romeo ' s girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms . lewis ' portrayal certainly didn ' t improve it . both women were anything but sexy or attractive . poorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems . it is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something . for example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope - out the mob scene . fine . jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite . fine . what does jack proceed to do ? he brushes his friends off by telling them he isn ' t feeling well , then strolls over to the boss . why ? the boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack ' s toes by the gravesite . i guess they weren ' t worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral . . . . or here ' s another : demarkov set - up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw . she proceeded to set the place on fire . wouldn ' t the flames burn off the fingerprints ? aren ' t dental records more important ? as bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be , couldn ' t she come up with a better plot ? ( and it took her no time at all to get a good - fitting , functional prosthesis . ) lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film . this film doesn ' t even add up the large details . there is little or no consistency in the story - line . not much makes sense . the direction lacks cohesion , surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable . the moods shift , the styles shift , and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one . so while it certainly isn ' t reservoir dogs , it certainly isn ' t diva . there ' s plenty more to tear apart in this film . my advice to someone who hasn ' t seen it to to wait until it comes on video . there are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously . it ' s not a boring film , just not a good one . or an intelligent one .", "a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i ' ve ever reviewed on paper . i didn ' t know at the time that i ' d soon encounter and despise batman & robin , which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer . as directed by joel schumacher ( who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isn ' t very good at either ) , b & r is one long excuse for a taco bell promotion . the plot , which has mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) planning to take over gotham city and then \" the vorld \" ( as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states ) , is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust , partnership , blah , blah , blah . but morals are not the point of this film -- topping each bloated , confusing action scene with next one is . the garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls . since when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel ? only george clooney comes out on top ; he underplays nicely and pretends like he ' s in a real movie .", "upon first viewing of this movie , the phrases \" been there \" and \" done that \" come quickly to mind . spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films , the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series . stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry , but only when you steal the right stuff . what little plot there is involves dick steele , aka . agent wd - 40 ( leslie nielsen ) trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith . along the way to it goal ( goal ? ) , the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films , but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act . the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny , or at the least , satirical . spy hard achieves neither , as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films . the \" dick , the world is in danger . what is it ? well , it ' s a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun . . ( i ' m paraphrasing ) \" type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film , each time getting progressively less funny . what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother ' s films while writing their own dialogue . director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors ( especially nielsen , who can do this quite well ) than on the delivery and context of their lines , much of the time cutting the punchline short . the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over , as is evident in the final sequence , where there is no comedic denouement after the climax . as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard , the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context . one of the more amusing was , \" captain of the enterprise . . . . . . james t . kirk \" . overall , i thought this was a very weak effort . while all of the right films to spoof were chosen , they used none of the right spoofing methods . next time they should \" spy \" a little bit harder . * * * * = excellent . one of a kind . must see . * * * = entertaining . worth the price of admission . * * = fair . nothing much special . * = what were they thinking ? ?", "accepting his oscar as producer of this year ' s best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over . one could almost say the same about his much - prized film . rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth . in short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him . his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld . the same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many . juliette binoche ' s nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart . at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger . even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical . with so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film ' s 160 minutes can be taxing . yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn ' t help but feel that greatness was in the air . hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern - day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war . there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years . but ultimately the emotional truths writer - director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed . in the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore . bore is perhaps too strong a word . but after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half - full .", "i don ' t expect much from eddie murphy these days . for the past four years , the gods of cinema -- or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates -- have allowed him to make one bad movie after another . such films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed - up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures . the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps . the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places . sherman has just invented a new \" youth drink \" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time . janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) . with love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers . with some convoluted mumbo - jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the \" buddy love \" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy - dandy lab beaker . but one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . . because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy . then the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes . and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ? the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene . pure and simple , the klumps is a failure . its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes . any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process . it ' s more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash . hey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes . the characterization of sherman ' s family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema . everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough . the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts . the father is gruff , is fired from a blue - collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings . the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone . the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood . sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to . but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy . the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct . and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn ' t act like this all the time . the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic . after a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story . its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line . even the best effects can ' t seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days . now that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make . people will be lined up around the block for it . the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 . eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he ' ll play every character in the movie . i just can ' t wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself .", "sandra bullock in high heels and wielding a chainsaw ? yup , it ' s gotta be summer . just when you thought the pointless sequel had gone the way of franchise films and direct - to - video releases , into port slams speed 2 : cruise control , the gloriously godawful follow - up to the 1994 sleeper about a bus rigged to explode if it slowed below a certain speed . the gimmick , this time , is an ocean liner rigged to , well , crash into stuff . sound exciting ?

( and said poisoning induced by prolonged exposure to electro - magnetic fields , no less ! calling dean edell . . . ) so , he overrides the boat ' s computer , convinces the crew to abandon ship , and sends the remaining passengers , those who couldn ' t evacuate in time , on a col - lision course with destiny . ( oddly , no one thinks to just . . . jump off the back of the boat . ) with keanu reeves electing not to return -- perhaps he read the script ? -- the job of john mcclane goes to jason patric ( sleepers ) , as the * second * la cop and swat team member that that bus drivin ' babe annie ( bullock ) has dated .

( and you thought the raptor slam was a cool summer movie move ? wait till you see the feats that * this * little girl can do , when stuck on a shipboard elevator ! ) bullock is her pesky , perky self , though she ends up with far less screen time than her top billing suggests . ( those paying attention to her bikini - and tank - tops probably won ' t complain , however ) patric is the main man in motion and that ' s damn good , ' cause when he stops to talk , he ' s only slightly less monotone than his predecessor . ( his first lol line is to ms . bullock : \" i ' d like to boogie with you . \" ) of course , nobody in front of the camera embarrasses themselves quite the way that returning director jan de bont does . he also produced this mess , which is insulting even by the most lax summer standards .

( oh , how far we ' ve come in twenty years . remember the simple fun of seeing a locomotive smash into railway station in the silver streak ? ) admittedly , either of the aforementioned sequences is worth the price of admission . it ' s just the rest of the movie -- the other hundred or so minutes -- that ' s pure nonsense . and wonderful nonsense at that . i know he didn ' t intend to , but de bont has done one thing right : he ' s created the hands - down funniest film of the year . so , now , allow to present a few more things that made me laugh : o a box with a big label : \" fiber optic converter \" o plain english , whole - sentence computer instructions o an entire sequence devoted to opening a fire door o jason patric ' s character walks onto the bridge and immediately understands everything that ' s happening o a ships ' navigator who speaks in a scottish accent and actually gets to say \" i canna override it ! \" o willem dafoe ' s amazing arm -

packed , and entertaining of the three films . the dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone . instead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears . even darth vader doesn ' t seem very intimidating this time around . with the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition - like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman . return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back . luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2 - d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke ' s home planet of tatooine . their goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt . it is at jabba ' s home , a creepy - looking stone fortress guarded by hog - nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play . from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba ' s sand barge , the effects are top notch . as soon as han is freed from his cryo - freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it ' s back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire ' s newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor . so , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks . there , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear - like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader . return of the jedi has some interesting elements . the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well - acted . from a technical point - of - view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films . not only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved . on one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects . in the special edition , even more ships are added , making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch . the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films . by now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on - screen personas . the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific . as in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for . newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he ' s not as imposing as vader was in star wars . although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen , return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment . with the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader ' s incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang . congratulations to george lucas , whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come . ,", "tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers , all searching for deeper meaning . however , they won ' t find much meaning in the real blonde , and not enough real humor , either . joe ( matthew modine ) is a struggling actor , or he claims to be one , even though he has no credits under his belt . his girlfriend , mary ( catherine keener ) has no pretensions about her career : she ' s a makeup artist , working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) and supermodel of the month , sahara ( bridgette wilson ) . sahara , who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid , has an on - again , off - again relationship with joe ' s best friend , bob ( maxwell caulfield ) . however , bob has gotten his biggest break yet : a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly ( daryl hannah ) , who may be that illusive woman he ' s always pursued : a real blonde . there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde , but not enough . the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background , such as sahara ' s perfume ads : \" depression - it ' s not just a state of mind \" . but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel . and , unfortunately , the film ' s forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic . take for example the film ' s framing device of an old lady and her dog . the story serves absolutely no purpose , makes little sense , and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie . matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film , but they ' re stuck in the most boring plotlines . modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley , who appears as another struggling actor . keener ' s character has a stronger edge , but the insult self - defense class ( taught by denis leary , no less ) she is stuck in makes little sense . the movie ' s running time is under two hours , but it seems like it is well over it . there ' s just not enough humor to speed things along , and not enough meaning to propel any drama .", "late in down to you , the lead female character ( julia stiles ) states her greatest fear is having an \" artificial conversation \" with her boyfriend ( freddie prinze jr . ) . the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out , fallen asleep , or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy . the film is a multi - million dollar testament to everything artificial . filled with characters , motivation , plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step this is an unquestionable disaster . prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles ' freshman co - ed . at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out - doing the previous in how \" cute \" it can be . the happy couple \" psychoanalyze \" each other ; they pick out a song because , as prinze ' s dj mother ( lucie arnez ) explains , every couple needs a song ; he smells her shampoo ; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love . then , in standard romantic comedy style , things fall apart . why ? well , because they have to . otherwise the couple can ' t make up and live ( presumably ) happily ever after . down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic . scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism , but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead . a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre , not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together , or even knowing each other , but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat . the supporting characters are remarkably flat , and insultingly ridiculous as well . stiles ' best friend ( rosario dawson ) is a pot head , prinze ' s roommate ( shawn hatosy ) is a girl crazy fool who can ' t meet women , and then there are the porn stars ( zak orth and selma blair ) . he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television , does the college lecture circuit , and stars in high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film . you know , the average porn star . the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he ' s on screen , the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes . she is a porn star mostly so we know she ' s slutty , so her very existence will make stiles jealous and prinze tempted . attempts at drama ( which means julia is going to cry ) include a pregnancy scare and the big break up . these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes . what happened here ? the cast is full of likable , promising , young actors ( stiles especially seems to be going places ) . writer / director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off . in fact the whole film feels like a reworking of last year ' s extremely unpleasant the story of us , for teen audiences . the direction is film - school - grad obvious . it ' s stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in split screen , a pointless parody of \" cops , \" characters walking into the flashbacks of other characters , and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves in extreme slow motion . plus , the whole story is told flashback style , narrated by prinze and stiles directly addressing the camera . this is the second film in a row ( following wing commander ) starring freddie prinze jr . which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she ' s all that . if he doesn ' t start making better choices fast his future films won ' t be so lucky .", "it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds . this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks ' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre ' s toilet paper . from this opening moment , one can infer shrek ' s defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney - esque fairy tale . although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye . while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community . the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world . the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way . their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone . shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey . courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey ' s immeasurable cowardice reveals itself . whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self - acknowledgment . but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire - breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage . he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them . secondly , upon shrek ' s and donkey ' s redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor . throughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona . an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona . children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his / her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist . after the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance . surprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night . in this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one ' s self . upon fiona ' s learning of shrek ' s desire to pursue a relationship with her , fiona , knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work , gives in to her inner demons of self - ridicule and hatred . any child can pull from fiona ' s transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self - acceptance . on the technical side , shrek triumphs . directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner , evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters . these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) , eddie murphy ( donkey ) , and cameron diaz ( princess fiona ) . myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other , \" normal \" beings . murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high - strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen . cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona , giving the princess / ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack . while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek , the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay , written by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , and roger s . h . schulman . the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer , combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike . capping it off with a constant tongue - in - cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features , the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers . with shrek , dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one - upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come . the smaller children will laugh and cheer ; the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not . a film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own , shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages .", "here i sit at my computer about to write my review of the recent action comedy \" bait \" starring jamie foxx and david morse . this is a review i don ' t even want to write because i ' d just be laying the same criticisms on it that i would with any other so -

oriented thriller released this year . turns out i was wrong , because while \" stigmata \" was merely boring and self - important , \" end of days \" is completely inept on all fronts . it ' s a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess . for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it ' s extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up . for the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and \" batman & robin \" doesn ' t count ) is no fun at all . \" end of days \" is a major stinker . the movie opens in vatican city , 1979 . some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation . if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed . the pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed . in new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy . twenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex - cop with a drinking problem . now working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil . an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney ) . recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her . there are so many problems with this film it ' s hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ? casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with . schwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea . arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions . in other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake . harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they ' ve all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger . there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho ' s character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine ' s location by offering him his old life back . none of these scenes really work , because arnie isn ' t up to the task . the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before . this one isn ' t at all believable the way arnold plays him . the supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all . as the prince of darkness , he ' s suave and confident . he acts like one would expect the devil to act . the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain . byrne out - performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil . byrne ' s speech about the bible being \" overrated \" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold ' s attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the \" ' tis not ! \" variety ) are feeble at best . the only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares . kevin pollack plays jericho ' s security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour . robin tunney isn ' t given much to do except look scared . in fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do . performances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it . this being an action blockbuster , it ' s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it ' s utterly ridiculous . why is the devil coming on new year ' s eve , 1999 ? because it ' s exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn ' t 666 , it turns out . some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you ' ve got 1999 ! if you don ' t buy this explanation , you ' re not alone . it ' s convoluted and silly at the same time . the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she ' s christine , see , and she lives in new york , see . . . ) , and if that weren ' t bad enough , there ' s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn ' t explained at all . why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex - cop , he ' s powerless ? is he impervious to only one kind of bullet ? how come he can ' t control jericho or christine ? and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ? a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it ' s never actually explained . usually , this sort of thing wouldn ' t matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don ' t get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting . there are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in \" end of days , \" complete with the old \" black cat hiding in a cabinet \" bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there . it gets so formulaic that it ' s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a \" boo \" will come . their predictions will rarely be wrong . the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don ' t care about these characters ( due to the script ' s pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don ' t make any sense . there ' s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady . it ' s good for a few chuckles , but not much else . supposedly we ' re to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly . none of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it ' s often hard to tell why it ' s happening in the first place , not to mention that they ' re edited in full - on incomprehensible mtv quick - cut style . most of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , \" wow , cool ! \" \" end of days \" is not only silly and confusing , but it ' s also distinctly unpleasant to watch . the devil apparently doesn ' t operate in the more subtle , i ' ll - convince - people - to - kill - each - other fashion outlined in the bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight . this doesn ' t only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that not a single scene in \" end of days \" goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me scratching my head ) . if violence is supposed to be shocking , it ' s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb . scenes aren ' t connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff gets blown up , or people get killed , and i had no idea why . reasons ? to hell with reasons ! let ' s just blow stuff up ! isn ' t it cool ? nope , not by a long shot . this film is thoroughly unwatchable . it ' s dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity . perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it ' s not happening with hack peter hyams here . \" end of days \" might have had camp value , if only it didn ' t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody ' s going to buy . if the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script . if it ' s going to be campy , arnold shouldn ' t be taking himself so damn seriously ( i didn ' t actually see him put up on a cross , did i ? ) , and his character shouldn ' t be such a sad sack . as it stands , \" end of days \" is just a bad movie , and an awfully gloomy one at that .", "a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings . family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand - wringing detail . still , i can ' t recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love . and after it , i still can ' t . bye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv - movie fare . only a few moments which have nothing to do with the film ' s main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion . bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children . dave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul - humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex - wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku ) . over the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic ' s blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny ' s growing estrangement from emma . the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality . randy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening . his run - ins with is ex - wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over - played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is gimmicky and implausible . he does get bye bye love ' s best sub - plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn . paul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy \" mad about you \" persona , but he does it well . as a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here . matthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible . this isn ' t a performance good enough to be called mailed - in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it . modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under - written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it ' s all his father ' s fault he ' s such a cad . carolco ' s executives , whose entire future is resting on modine ' s bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now . bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another \" dating in the 90s \" movie . when the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and / or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not . even more confusing is a sub - plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald ' s and befriends a troubled youth . it is a sad end to flanders ' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over - use of mcdonald ' s as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser . even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent - child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break - ups and their effects on children . any way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue . it is left to the dads ' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn ' t enough . there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching . bye bye love is a genuine shame .", "i ' m a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson ' s work . he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain . with teaching mrs . tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope . what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here . the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to . but where are the thrills ? the laughs ? both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge . and what a shame that is . i loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci - fi goofiness of the faculty . kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office . teaching mrs . tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign . or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties . i still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past . the title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over - the - top by british actress helen mirren . mrs . tingle is basically every student ' s worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard - working of her pupils . the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members . i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way . mirren ' s performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink . in other words , it ' s a poor substitute for williamson ' s best work . the plot is a big problem here . material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director . the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over - achiever hoping to get a college scholarship . but typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable . later on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo - copied duplicate of mrs . tingle ' s final exam . leigh ann ' s best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it . alas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning . in the morning . . . how convenient ! the three students head to mrs . tingle ' s house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann ' s name . things get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle . the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her . of course , not everything goes entirely to plan . besides pointless sub - plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress . there is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved . the humor is completely inconsistent . after many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze . you continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace . a moment like that never arises . williamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players , including the talented mckean and larry sanders ' vet tambor . and the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely . on the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher . while everything is pretty lifeless , teaching mrs . tingle remains watchable . there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script . mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching . she is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can ' t save individual scenes that flounder in boredom . if there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be ` disappointing ' . basically , kevin williamson is his worst enemy here . his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) . we will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real .", "film adaptation of hunter s . thompson ' s infamous semi - autobiographical hallucinogen - fueled book of the same title . director terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8 / 10 ) and brazil ( 7 / 10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5 / 10 ) ) \" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie \" , according to gilliam . plot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race . during their trip , they systematically consume \" two bags of grass , seventy - five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half - full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi - colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls . the movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use . critique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer ' s own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess . if you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels . if , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug - induced picture ' s entire ride ( 5 . 5 / 10 for all those sober dogs ) . note : i have not read thompson ' s book . having said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol - based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level . this movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot . it moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s . thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine . it was 1971 , and the times were apparently \" a ' changing \" in the states . johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop . during the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real - life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole . i thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk . the one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo . i couldn ' t believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7 . 5 / 10 ) . word on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible . plenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others . other than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn - burner , but then again , who really noticed . this movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug - ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream . and for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6 / 10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind . little known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine . bill murray also portrayed a thompson - based character in the film where the buffalo roam . johnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5 / 10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5 / 10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5 / 10 ) and what ' s eating gilbert grape ?

he ' s working from an atrocious script . only during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in \" 2001 \" ) where the rescue team ' s air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does \" mission to mars \" come to life . a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension , until you realize that the entire danger / more danger / attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film ; it ' s just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes . take it out , and the plot isn ' t affected in any way . the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes ( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship ' s computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from , uh , \" 2001 \" ) able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine ? why did tim robbins ' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ? shouldn ' t the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ? why are the characters such idiots ? because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them . all the \" conflict \" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : \" jim , it ' s too bad you can ' t go on this mission because you were determined ' psychologically inadequate ' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together \" -- does anyone really talk like this ? can ' t we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ? the whole film is like that . the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what ' s going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we ' re looking at * every * time . sample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : \" look , there ' s mars \" astronaut b : \" you sure that ' s mars ? \" astronaut a : \" yeah , that ' s mars all right . \" astronaut c : \" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? \" that exchange isn ' t actually in \" mission to mars , \" but i wouldn ' t be surprised if it were . for all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven ' t learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don ' t tell . de palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten . this is mentally - challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won ' t get what ' s going on , so they explain everything five times over . fourth - graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted . the principal actors sleepwalk their way through \" mission to mars , \" never managing to do away with an apparent \" i ' m just here to get a paycheck \" attitude . cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines . armin mueller - stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo . robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard \" decent guy \" performance . and sinise hams it up with \" wistful \" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy - handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen - from - no - less - than - three - movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub - par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then . and of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in \" 2001 \" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world . it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy \" mission to mars , \" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow - going . leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of \" mission to mars \" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters . supposedly we ' re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one - character - decides - not - to - return ending of \" armageddon \" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning . me , i alternated between the two . there is only one good thing about the way \" mission to mars \" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over .", "keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi - accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year ' s hawaii international film festival . on the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater . they need not have wasted their time . the movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor . there are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click . i wondered if there were jokes that i wasn ' t getting because i ' m not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn ' t be attributed to the cultural barrier either . keep cool just isn ' t very funny . the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool ' s producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii . although the print made it , the assistant ' s luggage was lost . too bad that story wasn ' t in the movie , because it got a big laugh . qu ying , the film ' s female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments . however , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms . ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast - paced , incredibly long tirade . it was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film . you see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes . at least that ' s the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving . cinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another . although some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying . headache , as i said . the film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying ) . they used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship . the first half of the film is about the young man ' s plan to win her back . of course the thing is , she doesn ' t want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit . in the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost . we later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced . there is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses . there is no sense to be made out of the young woman ' s behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character . the bookseller would be better off without her . although the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner ' s hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man . while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation . his quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time . a friendship develops between the two men , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate . although only an hour and a half in length , keep cool contains extraneous material . the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out , since we don ' t see her from the midpoint on . a case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner , and would have saved us from the bookseller ' s boring pursuit during the first half . but of course , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour . there are a few things that keep cool does right . as mentioned before , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good . although it grows tiresome , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic , and represents the differences in thinking between generations . in one scene , for example , the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across , but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted , and that it means something entirely different . also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene , such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner . the nightclub owner is counting out money , slapping each bundle of currency on the table . with every shot of his hand , we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge . unfortunately , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film ' s shortcomings , and weren ' t enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater .", "the first thing you notice about this movie is that it ' s cold . placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter , many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow - covered ground against a background of white . just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night . as with most coen brothers films , this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes , each of which works out in the oddest way possible . a car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father . along the way everything that can possibly go wrong does . in brief scenes of vicious violence , people get shot through the head , in the back , face , chest and various other areas of the anatomy . there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen . remarkably enough , most of the movie is played for laughs . even more remarkably , it works . the only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff ( frances mcdormand ) who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity . with every good film the audience gains new knowledge . here you learn _two_ things . everyone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy . and don ' t do violent illegal business with low - life amoral degenerate scum - sucking losers . oh yeah , if you get shot in the face , using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy .", "call it touched by a demon . gregory hoblit ' s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . in fact , there ' s even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion ' s share of the weirdness distilled out . ( remember bob ? ) the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it ' s consistently interesting , it ' s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , \" what goes around really goes around . \" shortly thereafter , he begins to sing \" time is on my side \" as he ' s taken on his last walk . minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn ' t a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . and , with reese ' s death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they ' re up against . the rest of the cops , including hobbes ' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don ' t have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . the most famous landmark to appear isn ' t the liberty bell or independence hall ; it ' s geno ' s steaks . shadows and night scenes abound . the days are cloudy and unpromising . this is the kind of setting where it ' s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . fallen ' s plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . sadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring . washington ' s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . it ' s not that he ' s bad per se , but he ' s not very interesting . there ' s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life - or - death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . washington ' s subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . however , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler ' s list ) and donald sutherland . to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren ' t all acting - related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well - written . that said , however , there ' s nothing inspired about either davidtz ' s or sutherland ' s work . both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi - dimensional individual . narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game - like structure , it uses a denzel washington - supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . at times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like \" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself \" become a little hard to swallow . in addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . however , despite the negatives , i ' m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . the final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . it ' s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . this is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it ' s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . and , whatever you do , don ' t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll .", "the comet - disaster flick is a disaster alright . directed by tony scott ( top gun ) , it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth . and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble . jeez . after a great opening , in which an american spaceship , plus the city of new york , are completely destroyed by a comet shower , nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy . they hire the world ' s best oil driller ( bruce willis ) , and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem . that ' s like sending a mouse into a cat carrier , isn ' t it ? the action in armageddon are so over the top , nonstop , and too ludicrous for words , i had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a couple of times . i was not alone . plus , to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of the actor ' s talents . the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots . the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out - perform deep impact . producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon .", "brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly . since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames . consequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito ' s way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes . it doesn ' t hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn . carlito ' s way , while hampered by depalma ' s characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama . carlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life - long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance . in 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality . he declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas . among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito ' s crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) . carlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace . old ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can ' t seem to shake . carlito ' s way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film . in the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station . both highlight depalma ' s gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely . yet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling . carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit . but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there ' s more of an immediacy to carlito ' s way , an ever - present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion . you sense that there ' s no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble . indeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : \" you don ' t get reformed ; you just run out of wind . \" pacino captures carlito ' s dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy . sean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld . a jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder . he could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct . he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting . as compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu . depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas . he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . from a story standpoint , there ' s an obligatory love story with a cliche ' d long - suffering girlfriend character . penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn ' t do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story . still , it ' s easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid . the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn ' t break . carlito ' s way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful . those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well - rewarded .", "almost a full decade before steven spielberg ' s saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both \" anti war \" and \" pro - soldier \" , john irvin ' s hamburger hill proved it could . lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone ' s platoon , this excellent film was dismissed as \" too militaristic \" . it ' s hard to understand exactly why --- unless irvin , in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable ( and often naive ) reasons \" chose to show up \" for the vietnam debacle , --- has refused to present us with the stone killer , drug - stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what \" the polack , the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn \" became to wwii movies . hamburger hill , based on a true story , is not an easy film to watch . there is a scene that will have graying anti - war activists squirming in their seats , or moved to genuine tears . and the climactic final assault on the \" hill \" in question is visually confusing . gristly realities are presented in brief flashes , as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered . and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee , veteran and \" newbie \" , black soldier and white , become almost indistinguishable from each other , as they do in the chaos of actual combat . the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b . vance as doc -- in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as \" seaman jones \" in mctiernan ' s red october . if you ' ve seen private ryan , you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill -- if only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielberg ' s vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach .", "young einstein is embarrassingly lame , but that didn ' t stop it from becoming a phenomenon in australia , where it became the third largest box office hit of all time . in the u . s . , warner brothers is hoping the movie will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan , inxs , and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under . personally , i ' m hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb . young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious , who not only wrote , produced , edited , and directed the film , but also starred and did his own stunts . his creation is about as stupid and contrived as you ' d expect from someone named yahoo . the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein ' s youth . whereas the scientist actually hailed from germany , the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania , a remote australian island . in addition to deriving the formula for energy and the theory of relativity , albert invents surfing , bubbles in beer , and the electric guitar . yahoo plays einstein as a naive and unrefined country hick -- a clown with an insatiable curiosity . although yahoo ' s performance is at first endearing , the one - dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can say e = mc2 . yahoo has created a charming family for albert , and the scenes on tasmania are often clever . but after the first twenty minutes , the movie quickly plummets and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy . young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace and inane plot . yahoo must be an mtv addict because his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack ; unfortunately , the music is altogether gratuitous and quickly becomes overbearing . almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video . the instrumental score , on the other hand , is generally playful ; yahoo uses such classics as the \" 1812 overture \" and the theme from the good , the bad and the ugly to great comic effect . halfway through young einstein , i knew for sure the movie was a stinker . but it wasn ' t until the very end that i finally put my finger on why : the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies ( such as young sherlock holmes ) but from cheesy prime - time sitcoms . in fact , young einstein might have been more at home on network television , where its sophomoric humor wouldn ' t raise any eyebrows .", "in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly - overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us . president john kennedy ( bruce greenwood ) and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson ' s dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in \" thirteen days . \" one of the highlights to come out of made - for - tv movies was a 1974 entry called \" missiles of october \" that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us , ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown . that teleplay , starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby , showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962 . now , a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie , director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again ( the last time was for the taught spy thriller \" no way out \" ) to re - enact the events of that most dangerous time in america ' s and the world ' s history . taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p . o ' donnell ( costner ) , donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event , once again , as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war . as o ' donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning , he deals with the usual family crises and problems . meanwhile , a u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images - medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment . suddenly , ken ' s routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat . where \" thirteen days \" differs most from \" missiles of october \" is , as expected , in the scope of the project . there is a big difference , budget - wise , between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen . it shows as the makers of \" thirteen days \" craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house , it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation . the cast , a true ensemble , is led , surprisingly , by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner . costner ' s o ' donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family . this puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america ' s preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know . kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe , but he knows that , if the crisis comes to a head , his family will be no more . the meat of \" thirteen days \" is in the big picture , not the microcosm of family , though . this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels . the story does not just cover the face - off between the world ' s two most powerful countries ; it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military / cia . the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro . the missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army / navy / air force want to flex their might and invade cuba , while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america ' s dignity and world leadership intact . while the internal battle for power rages in the white house , with air force chief curtis lemay ( kevin conway ) advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age , our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba . this is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action . when the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter , the tension is palpable . the most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u2 is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti - aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane . this is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least , making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles . the ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players . greenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk , foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent . instead , he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office , directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options . kennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president . costner , as ken o ' donnell , is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor . costner plays o ' donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech . the rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy . the rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast , too . standing out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un , adlai stevenson , who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly . the filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy , using old style video footage to good effect . dylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara . kevin conway gives his general lemay the right \" bomb them to hell \" attitude . also notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who , with his wingman , takes on the dangerous mission of a low - level photo recon into the heart of cuba , bravely challenging kenny o ' donnell ' s admonition , \" don ' get shot . \" tech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on a war footing . it ' s an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film a veracity fitting the event . solid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys . there is the usual array of vintage cars from the period to make things look right . the special f / x of the u2 sequences are a nice crafting of computer imaging . the cuban missile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the united states has ever faced in its survival as a world leader . helmer donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of the finest docudramas of the year . i give \" thirteen days \" an a - .", "what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection . sometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have , i will prefer it to a better - made film that is not as thought - provoking . the thin red line is flawed but it provokes . terence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war . unlike this year ' s saving private ryan , which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof , the thin red line simply says war is waste . while that might seem obvious to some , only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is . saving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs . one message is not necessarily more correct than the other . it just depends on one ' s point of view . in malick ' s film , war is set in a tropical paradise , and john toll ' s cinematography is beyond lush . the setting poses the question , why are we fighting in the face of such beauty ? in saving private ryan , the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go . in the thin red line , the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place . they are just like the americans -- frightened and angry , grieving and praying . all that separates them is war . the flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice - overs . unbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious , sometimes corny , the voice - overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary . dispensing with them , malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur . instead , he gets distracting self - consciousness . aside from that , malick ' s direction is stunning . the tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary . sean penn , elias koteas , and nick nolte give the best performances . penn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism , koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain , and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle . john travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles . ultimately however , the thin red line ' s interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama . it has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure , but malick clearly has different things on his mind . has no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative ? what malick is working with is theme , and in that , the thin red line is most provoking .", "i have a great idea for a movie , one that can ' t miss . see , i ' ve got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack , and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances . it ' s about professional basketball , so i ' ll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity . as for what the movie is actually about . . . well , that will all sort itself out eventually . i figure it will be a comedy , so i ' ll throw a half - dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with . maybe we ' ll put a gender spin on it , see if we can get some women out to see it , too . eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind . twister , as inane as the script might have been , at least required some creative technicians ; mission : impossible , overwrought plot and all , at least involved genuine effort . eddie just sits there , hawking up a formula story without any laughs , and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required . whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin , a new york limo driver and die - hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team . coach john bailey ( dennis farina ) has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas , and the losses are beginning to mount . the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess ( frank langella ) to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team . the winner ( surprise , surprise ) is eddie , who becomes a fan favorite , and eventually the actual coach . the knicks continue to lose , but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops . incidentally , the knicks eventually start winning . please raise your hand if that comes as a shock , and i will invite you to my all - night marathon of the bad news bears , major league , angels in the outfield , the mighty ducks , the big green , cool runnings and little giants . awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds ; it ' s what they do . those teams usually involve kids , for a very sound comedic reason : it ' s funnier when they screw up , and they ' re more sympathetic . those which _don ' t_ involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles , for another very sound comedic reason : they generally have developed some sort of comic timing . eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it ' s easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players . this finds nba players like greg ostertag , dwayne schintzius , rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper ( though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players ) . perhaps that all didn ' t matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines , and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick . steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming , \" don ' t blame me , i just work here . \" perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn ' t a movie -- it ' s a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while . among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump , new york mayor rudolph giulianni , former new york mayor ed koch , david letterman , letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam , espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert , as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas . and those are the real jokes in eddie . nothing these individuals say or do is funny ; you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice , \" hey , it ' s donald trump ! \" or \" hey , it ' s mujibur and sirajul ! \" it ' s difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can ' t even get the cliches in a cliche - ridden genre script right . the knicks coach who is eddie ' s antagonist early in the film reappears at the end , but he isn ' t given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs . neither is frank langella , and none of the athlete - actors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of . that leaves her to do her street - wise miss thang routine , but with no character , no sharp lines and no help . eddie isn ' t just a bad movie with a formulaic premise . it ' s a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended , because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie , and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy .", "the rocky horror picture show ' special edition ' ( 1975 ) starring : tim curry and susan sarandon cult films are never mainstream . the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused , yelling out ' what the hell is that ?

' holocaust comedy receives standing ovation ' , the headlines read . intrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years . even though the movie was extremely well - received by critics and public alike , i couldn ' t help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated . only now do i see the error of my ways . after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a \" holocaust comedy \" ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps . rather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation . roberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin - inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse ) . through the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this \" beautiful princess \" , as he calls her . employing the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini ) . life treats them well until hitler ' s minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son ' s innocence no matter what the sacrifice . granted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a \" hogan ' s heros \" and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews . somehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it ' s gravely serious subject . so , we ' ve established that life is beautiful is not a \" holocaust comedy \" . but , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me . the film , despite critic ' s declarations of it being a \" triumph of the human spirit \" , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway . some have called the story an \" affirmation of the beauty of life \" , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man ' s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy . the film ' s ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting . essentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film . however , i am not denying the movie ' s greatness . believe me , it ' s fantastic . i ' m just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as . but perhaps i ' m reading more into the movie than is really there . maybe the film ' s brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit . in fact , maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it .", "except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy , that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through . bette midler and dennis farina play lilly and dan , actress and author , once married , now violently divorced , and back together one last time for their daughter molly ' s ( paula marshall ) wedding . lilly and dan hate each other passionately -- so passionately that they have sex at the wedding and fall in love again . each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the other . molly , married now only 24 hours , runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith ( jamie denton ) tries to console the abandoned spouses . in molly ' s search for her parents , she somehow falls in love with lilly ' s paparazzo joey ( danny nucci ) . meanwhile , the newlywed keith ends up consoling dan ' s wife rowena ( gail o ' grady ) in bed . the audience i saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery was hilarious . i ' m no dan quayle , but i thought it was a bit creepy . the message seemed to be \" ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish . \" \" family values \" aside , there ' s something cruel about all this . perhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy , but the movie is a romantic comedy . we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps . reiner and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable . lilly ' s husband is a new - age flake who rambles about \" emotional valet parking , \" so we can write him off as irrelevant . dan ' s wife is vain , manipulative , and jealous so we can write her off as a bitch . molly ' s husband is a career - conscious , self - centered republican politician who thinks she ' s too fat ( and just for good measure , he also fucked dan ' s wife ) , so we can write him off as a prick . everyone else falls in love . but still , that somehow doesn ' t justify the actions of the movie ' s main characters . \" he ' s a prick \" or \" she ' s a bitch \" is no defense . the movie is somewhat redeemed by some funny dialog -- often during heated arguments -- and by above - average performances by midler and farina ( breaking out of his character - actor mold ) . other than that , it ' s a standard romantic comedy with a very substandard gimmick .", "it has happened again . a movie that is well scripted , well acted , and well directed . it is involving , suspenseful . . . it even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus . but in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie . the sixth sense is that movie . starring bruce willis ( armageddon ) as a child psychologist and haley joel osment ( forrest gump ) as a troubled youngster , the sixth sense is more spooky than scary , though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle . eight - year - old cole sear ( osment ) sees dead people . not just in dreams . and not just as lifeless bodies . he sees them walking around like regular people . and he sees them all the time . dr . malcolm crowe ( willis ) is trying to help him . he recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed , resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself . if crowe could manage to find a way to help cole , he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest . but first he needs to gain cole ' s trust . the boy is so frightened by what he sees , he has closed himself off emotionally , being unwilling to tell anyone . . . not crowe , not even his own mother ( toni collette , clockwatchers ) . . . about his \" secrets . \" crowe begins to spend more and more time with him , even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him , his wife anna ( olivia williams , rushmore ) becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy . bruce willis underplays his role , allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development . crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won ' t communicate , to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations , to wondering if perhaps there isn ' t some truth behind what the boy sees . mr . willis does a serviceable job , letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona . eleven - year - old haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance . he demonstrates an amazing amount of self - composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro . it is fine work for one of such a tender age . keep your eye on this young man . the supporting cast is also quite effective . toni collette , as the confused , frightened , and frustrated mother who can ' t understand what is happening to her child ; olivia williams , as crowe ' s once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband ; and donnie wahlberg ( ransom ) as crowe ' s ex - patient , now grown , who illustrates his doctor ' s failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable . twenty - eight year old m . night shyamalan ( wide awake ) directed his own script , maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the film ' s full impact is not reached until its final moments , when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it . it is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr . shyamalan , as the one responsible , is certainly to be commended . in giving the sixth sense a favorable \" three star \" review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit , i must also point out that , spiritually speaking , the film is highly misleading . there is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the \" living dead . \" the concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself . the first lie recorded in the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve , \" thou shall not surely die , \" a direct contradiction of god ' s admonition . that same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages . scriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ . . . an event which has not yet occurred . therefore , the dead remain in a state of oblivion , having no consciousness , until that long - awaited time when the final trump shall sound . and then , you ' ll need six senses to register all the joy and rejoicing that will resound throughout the heavens .", "mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . his entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have . joe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars . during this scene , i turned to my friend and said , \" wow . that ' s some ape . \" joe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . he runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . he picks things up and stares at them pensively . he breaks things on accident , because he ' s just too big to avoid clumsiness . joe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes . as a character , he doesn ' t quite register . and the story he ' s been put in is as limp as they come . the words \" family entertainment \" have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart . the picture is a remake of the 1949 film . it ' s mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters . the main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas . as a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife . specifically , she ' s out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood . soon , zoologist gregg o ' hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill ' s mother . so , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . in addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . and , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill ' s mother . jill , of course , doesn ' t recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . the movie isn ' t really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . but the story is really dumb , there aren ' t any characters , and the film isn ' t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . the movie also has bad dialogue . if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it ' s only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like \" joe isn ' t happy ! \" and \" joe isn ' t safe here ! \" \" we need to get joe out of here ! \" \" joe is way too big for that cage ! \" i don ' t know if these phrases are word for word , but they ' re close . as i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . sadly , mighty joe young wastes them both . there are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . it ' s certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . but adults in the audience aren ' t likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla . nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla .", "errol morris , critically acclaimed director of the 1997 documentary fast , cheap and out of control , vaults to new heights with mr . death . this film , an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred a . leuchter , jr . , is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise , stunning even the more jaded minds among us . don ' t let the film ' s cheesy dissuade you . following this sideshow of horror - lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non - stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter ' s life and mind . morris follows the trail of leuchter ' s madness with appalling lucidity , revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with : this leuchter guy is seriously messed up . virtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls , leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession ; designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries , in spite of his lack of credentials . after a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows , leuchter came to the attention of neo - nazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel , who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his ` theory ' that the holocaust never happened . morris ' s interviews are surprisingly congenial , drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves . zundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch . leuchter seems completely at ease , sometimes jovial . part of this effect may be due to morris ' s new interviewing machine , called the interrotron , which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer . this was the first time morris had used the device , and the results are startling . combine the irony of these interviews with leuchter ' s reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau , not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant , and you ' ve got one compelling and disturbing documentary . while this film isn ' t for the feeble - minded or weak - hearted , it is a valuable addition to the cultural landscape . aside from a few dragging minutes toward the end of the piece , morris has given us a fresh look at a dismal subject and i , for one , feel bettered by the experience .", "when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy , i expect negative reviews from critics left and right . predictable , unoriginal , and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you ' s and the drive me crazy ' s released by the dozens these last couple of years . what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i ' m sitting in the theater . am i enjoying myself ? is this a comfortable break from my week of finals ? this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks ; i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won ' t remember next week . so last week i opened up the new york times - and , no surprise , boys and girls got a negative review . daily news ? negative . reelviews ? negative . epinions . com ? negative . this was nothing new . american pie , final destination , road trip didn ' t get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures . same goes for she ' s all that , a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded . since boys and girls reunites she ' s all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr . , i predicted d ? j ? vu al over again . but , still curious , i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it , the reactions were far from positive . i had made up my mind ; i ' ll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years . but , soon after , following a series of unexpected events ( we couldn ' t get into shaft because it is rated r ) , i found myself watching boys and girls . whoops . boys and girls is about a \" nerdy , smart \" boy named ryan ( prinze jr . ) and a \" popular , flirt \" girl named jennifer ( claire forlani ) . briefly meeting as pre - teens and now attending the same college , the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends . but in the movies , a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other . with advice from their roommates ( amanda detmer , jason biggs ) , ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship . the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives - and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found . i could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons . the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie , mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to . it is almost offensive . an example of an insightful conversation : \" you ' re dumb . dumb , dumb , dumb , dumb . \" \" no . \" ( followed by a mandy moore - esque tune background ) ( well it ' s not as bad as wing commander i guess ) the supporting cast is also painfully useless . detmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring , pointless subplots . and although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex , prinze jr ' s ryan dominates the screen while forlani ' s jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with . we never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character . teenager or not : you ' ll hate this movie , i guarantee it . maybe i should rent she ' s all that again . is it really as good as i think it is ?", "\" alcohol and drugs = bad . not alcohol and drugs = good . got it ? \" just when you though you ' ve seen enough of brave young women dealing with their personal problems on screen , be that insanity or alcoholism , hollywood releases yet another one of those ' deep , emotional stories about finding yourself ' . . ' 28 days ' is practically a visualization of the usual ' meaningful ' true stories that people are so proudly retelling at aa - meetings . gwennie ( sandra bullock ) is a young woman who drowned her problems in alcohol . for her life was a big party , with no beginning and no end . this behavior has of course estranged her from her only sister and from life itself . her existence is filled with endless parties and comic episodes . such as when she got drunk with boyfriend jasper ( dominic west ) , borrowed her sister ' s ( elizabeth perkins ) wedding limo and crashed it into someone ' s house . this time she had to pay with a 28 day stay in court - ordered rehab . here she must realize that the only thing that can save her is her is redemption , willpower and commitment . most important she must realize her place and direction in life and understand that her life is not just a big party . the film itself feels like a rehab program , whining and moaning about things that have been said and written a million times . it is a classic cautionary tale . an echo . a big , fat and expensive clich ? . a shadow of last year ' s ' girl , interrupted ' , which likewise followed in the footsteps of great masterpieces like ' the cuckoo ' s nest ' and ' trainspotting ' . director betty thomas has stuffed her film with so many failures and errors , that it is impossible to sum them all up in one review . for some paranoid reason she decided to make her film a drama / comedy . jokes and funny characters almost deliberately delude you from the really important and complex issues : alienation , despair , terror , confusion , loneliness . and what awesome power and strength of character it actually takes to overcome all that and become clean . isn ' t that what the filmmakers wanted to show in the first place ? even the transition process itself seems like a walk in the park . betty thomas ' idea of hell is a cozy , homey place where happy alcoholics and cheerful drug addicts are not allowed to smoke , drink or watch tv after 11 . it is simply too light , simplified and unnecessary sweet to be taken seriously . but the worst thing about it is that it actually thinks that it is saying something of significance . that it actually tries to educate the audience with its extremely predictable and primitive story . \" all you need to do is just say no \" , says dr . cornell ( steve buscemi ) as if was the revelation of the century . and that ' s how simple it is ! in fact i would rather watch ' lost in space ' once again , than return to ' 28 days ' . as for acting , it ' s acceptable , but hardly anything else . for sandra bullock it ' s an opportunity to demonstrate that she is capable of more than ' speed ' . she handles her part with a surprising professionalism and ease that certainly saves the film from being a complete flop . dominic west shines as the source of gwenie ' s devilish temptations , but elizabeth perkins ' and steve buscemi ' s great talents are wasted on unnoticeable and shallow characters . although intellectually ' girl , interrupted ' was a greater achievement , ' 28 days ' is superior in its visual aspect . there are some nice flash back sequences and occasionally impressive pacing , but the overall technical aspect of this film is on the ground floor . the most important thing is that we ' ve seen it before and it was a lot better . ' clean and sober ' , ' only when i laugh ' , ' when a man loves a woman ' , ' leaving las vegas ' and many other stronger films were made about the same issues . so what ' s the point ? in other words ' 28 days ' doesn ' t contribute to the moviemaking business on any level . if you ' re caught in a snowstorm or bolts of lightning fall from the sky and you ' re standing in front of the movie theatre , you might as well go in and watch ' 28 days ' . under all other circumstances stay away , because this film equals $ 8 and 103 minutes lost .", "confucius once said , \" governing a nation is like cooking a small fish -- don ' t overdo it . \" his maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script , for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make . granted , mike judge , writer - director of the workplace satire office space isn ' t exactly an amateur ( his most infamous work , the mtv series \" beavis and butt - head \" was pure gold for its network ) . but unfailingly , judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground . the iffiness in judge ' s plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal . in fact , based on the popularity of scott adams ' cartoon \" dilbert , \" which will soon have its own television series , a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood . unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit - length sequences which would be more at home on the set of \" saturday night live \" rather than a full - length feature . the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space , which feature almost all of the movie ' s top content ; this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated . other evidence of office space ' s failure to work are its lack of good jokes . the comedy is marginally funny at best , but not enough to get a packed house of theater - goers to laugh out loud . the material in the movie is on - key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting , and this could partially explain his work here . however , the movie is loaded with too many misfires -- including the token plot -- to allow for any excuse . the plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers , headed up by peter gibbons ( ron livingston ) , at a company named initech . after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech , the movie introduces us to two consultants ( john c . mcginley and paul willson ) which are in charge of \" downsizing \" the company ' s payroll . when peter and his gang learns of this , as well as the reason behind it -- so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) ' s stock will go up -- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall . the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but . a sympathetic cast and a muddled jennifer aniston - as - love - interest subplot are all that keep this one together , but it ' s definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent .", "ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances . for his followup to the academy - beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women ) . despite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences . the film opens in the mid - 1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england . as the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback . meanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest . lucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology . lucinda is rich ; oscar is poor . lucinda is forward and self - assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself . yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it ' s on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin . and fate has decreed that they will one day meet . that day doesn ' t occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help . another of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly - acquired glassworks factory . at first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn ' t take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other . a friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent . but oscar is uncertain of lucinda ' s affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her . oscar and lucinda isn ' t beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions . on more than one occasion , it ' s apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route . coincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can ' t go anywhere . the voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments . ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . ) yet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda . storyline faults pale in the light of two such finely - realized characters . thematically , the film is also strong . the unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated . oscar and lucinda don ' t just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls . a card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional \" strip poker \" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion . oscar does not see gambling as a vice . in fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one ' s immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith . ralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar . the actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on - screen . as good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett . the actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford ' s paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda . she gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles . effective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen ' s persuasion ) as lucinda ' s close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar ' s mentor , and clive russell as a self - serving adventurer . there ' s a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence . ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . ) with the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package . the characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett . so who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ? oscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer .", "\" what ' s your favorite new york moment ? \" \" this one ' s climbing the charts . \" starring john cusack , kate beckinsale , eugene levy , molly shannon . directed by peter chelsom . rated pg - 13 . there ' s no doubt that 95 % of romantic comedies follow a distinct pattern : guy sees girl , guy wants girl , guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl , guy gets girl . in rare cases , the genders are flipped . predictability is a given . rarely , though , is a romantic comedy as cheap , as obvious , or as pointless as serendipity , a film that uses its \" theme \" as an excuse for its plot contrivances . \" lightweight \" doesn ' t begin to describe it . this is like anti - gravity . it begins in a new york city bloomingdale ' s , a product placement that rivals cast away ' s fedex for sheer blatancy . jonathan trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale ) both go for the same pair of gloves . after going through the perfunctory motions , jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream , followed by ice skating . jonathan falls hard , and sara is charmed . when she writes her name and number down on a piece of paper , a truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand . she takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldn ' t be together ; jonathan is flabbergasted . to pacify him , she comes up with an idea : jonathan will write his number on a 5 dollar bill , which she will promptly spend . when she gets home , she will write her name and number inside a book ( \" love in the time of cholera \" ) and sell it to a used bookstore . if the bill gets back to her or the book to him , it will mean that they are meant to be together . three years later . both sara and jonathan are now engaged to other love interests . both realize they aren ' t content . both go looking for the other . what happens now is so absurd that i ' m almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it . the two of them run circles around each other in a set of incredible \" coincidences \" that i would describe as contrivances if it weren ' t for the film oh - so - cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around \" serendipity . \" of course , since the movie is about fate , the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases . i ' m not buying it . there ' s no suspense in any of this because we know exactly what ' s going to happen , but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly \" adorable \" non - story into our heads . instead of \" will they meet ? \" the question we ' re asking is \" when will they meet already ? \" to make matters worse , every \" coincidence \" is telegraphed from a mile away ; by the last reel i was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else \" incredible \" was going to happen . cusack is fine and beckinsale , at least , isn ' t saddled with another lumbering , clunky screenplay ( she ' s had bad luck , what with brokedown palace and pearl harbor on her resume ) , just an inanely pointless one . serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy , who plays a snarky bloomingdale ' s salesman . what ' s the interest in watching a movie that spirals around and around a predestined ( no pun intended ) conclusion ? serendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings , but it only tests our patience .", "ingredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python ' s spanish inquisition synopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ? believe it . sliding doors is a love ' what if ' story . the gimmick is that it ' s really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions . in the beginning , likeable gal ' helen ' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job . so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live - in lover gerry ( john lynch ) . helen doesn ' t know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future . the film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories . in story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train . arriving home early , she discovers that her live - in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) . this leads to a life where helen moves out . helen ' s winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business . in story two , helen experiences a different fate . she misses the train , never meets james , and doesn ' t get home early enough to discover gerry ' s infidelity . in this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry . will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ? opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks . at last here ' s proof that there ' s still creativity in 1990s filmmaking . sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year . not only is it a well - acted , heartwarming film , but it ' s also easily gwyneth paltrow ' s best recent performance . when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a ' shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she ' s talking about ! nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes . nobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , \" i will find you no matter what , my darling ! \" when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she doesn ' t take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she ' s supposed to be recovering from heartache . and handsome live - in boyfriend gerry isn ' t the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob ) . instead he ' s a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk . another example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the ' hospital miracle ' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation . in other words , all of the characters seem non - stereotyped , human , and local . there are minor inconveniences . since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it ' s occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two . distinguishing between the two stories isn ' t a problem in the scenes containing paltrow , who sports two different hairstyles . but in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it ' s slightly confusing . also , quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture ( seinfeld , woody allen , etc . ) are spoken by the british characters . but these seem slightly forced , given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang . possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable ? sliding doors is a charming , quirky , original , happy romance with a little ' philosophy of fate ' thrown in . monty python and the meaning of fate , anybody ?", "in roger michell ' s romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it ' s name to the film ' s title . one day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey . quickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on - again , off - again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat . the film opens with a non - verbal cue to anna ' s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress ' s appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such . without words , this sequence gives us a background to her character . following , however , is a set - up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives . i don ' t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn ' t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie ' s beginning , but there it is . if there were ever a clear case for \" less is more , \" this would be it . the film is told nearly first person from william ' s point of view , as he is in every scene . by nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . in fact , much of notting hill ' s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he ' s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey - soaked apricots from his refrigerator . or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . william assures her he wouldn ' t say a word , then adds , \" well , i ' ll probably tell myself now and then , but i ' d never believe it . \" great stuff . the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don ' t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . we ' re constantly exposed to william ' s thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don ' t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we ' re not sure what she ' s been thinking all the times in between . this , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant ' s film hands down . he gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance . julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress ' s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character ' s unpredictable behavior . anna doesn ' t get a lot of our compassion . this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast . most notable is rhys ifans as spike , william ' s eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh . hugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william ' s friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister ' s birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . it ' s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . roger michell ' s use of visuals doesn ' t sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . for example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying \" eight months later , \" michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william ' s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him . another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air . we ' re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird ' s eye view of the ground below . music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film ' s scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . it ' s kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today ' s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . notting hill ' s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all - time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . for a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that ' s not so bad , now is it ?", "movie reviewers have an obligation to see the good , the bad , and the despicable . i originally wrote this review for my college newspaper back in ' 95 , but i wanted to re - write it because not all retro reviews should be about the classics . we need to be warned about some truly awful films , too . this picture was so bad , it inspired the description for my 1 / 10 rating ( see ratings chart below ) . the only thing saving it from a 0 / 10 rating is that being able to rent a movie like this is slightly less embarassing than renting a porno . so , it does indeed have some plusses . . . in fairness , elizabeth berkley is certainly worth seeing in the buff . and her ability to whine and irritate us , even while nude , was appropriate in her role as selfish temptress nomi malone . this character is not smart , not interesting , and ( deliberately ? ) far too annoying far too often . like in 1998s \" bulworth \" , when the movie was over i didn ' t care one little iota about the main character . at least warren beatty tried to make a statement with his dreary and overrated film , though . \" showgirls \" is too stupid to make a statement . some people claim that the story is based on the legendary \" all about eve \" of all things ! if exploitation expert joe eszterhas was half the screenwriter that joseph l . mankiewicz was , he ' d be . . . well , he ' d be a good screenwriter . instead , this project may have sunk his career . he wrote the ( ha ha ! ) script and the usually reliable paul verhoeven directed . the same team who created a good sex - film in 1992 ( \" basic instinct \" ) struck out here with their occasional violence , gratuitous x - rated sex scenes , and numerous ( and quite unnecessary ) lesbian overtones . the predictable storyline revolves around nomi streaking into las vegas to make it big as a dancer . after the supposed street - smart young \" lady \" gets conned out of her suitcase by a slack - jawed yokel in the opening sequence , she befriends a tailor of the glamorous stage production at the \" stardust hotel \" . nomi doesn ' t take advantage of this contact to break into the big - time of dirty dancing right away . first , she becomes a lap dancer at a scummy strip club . she sells her hot little wares at \" the cheetah \" for a short time , turning on the fictitious customers and the actual theatre audience . hey , i never said she wasn ' t a hot number . . . maybe it ' s that , her body , which gets her into the big - time when the star of the \" stardust hotel \" , crystal connors ( gina gershon ) stops into the strip club ( it certainly isn ' t her brains or pleasant disposition ! ) . crystal requests a private lap dance for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) . he also happens to be the pleasure - seeking worm who runs the big show . crystal gets nomi onto the \" stardust \" team and , after an interminable amount of time , nomi \" earns \" the role of crystal ' s understudy . the slut then deliberately injures and hospitalizes crystal . it was almost laughable that nomi had the guts to claim that she ' s \" not a whore \" . that ' s a phrase we hear a few different times and it ' s completely ludicrous . of course she is ! she sells her soul to make it big , but in the end we ' re supposed to believe that she ' s a better person than that . we ' re supposed to root for her . no way ! she ' s a tramp and a back - stabber who deserved nothing -- least of all vindication in the . . . ahem . . . climax . she is not a good person and they take over two hours to explain that the audience should think that she is . the sub - plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claims to see talent in nomi is just a gratuitous opportunity to let her dance naked a little bit more . it sure ain ' t character development ! plummer also appeared in \" speed \" in ' 94 in a smaller , yet better role . this sub - plot goes absolutely nowhere except maybe to deliver an unsubtle hint that fornicators should practice birth control . kyle maclachlan must have been promised a big pay - day or his standards have dipped since appearing in \" blue velvet \" . that picture was weird , but some critics claim it ' s one of the best movies of the ' 80s . now ol ' kyle can say that he acted in one of the worst of the ' 90s , too . his sleazy character is important to \" showgirls \" , but we don ' t learn anything about him . he uses people to get what he wants , but that only means that he fits in well with the other characters in this movie . is he a villain ? who cares ! ultimately , this movie is as tiresome as it is explicit . everyone must know by now about the soft - core acts of copulation , especially the riotous romp between berkley and maclachlan in his pool . what few reviewers take issue with is how mean - spirited this movie is . everyone ' s either having sex , exacting revenge , or wishing they were having sex or exacting revenge . it ' s just too hard to take ( especially for over two hours ) . if we must be exposed to the evils of the vegas world , why couldn ' t verhoeven have also made a point of highlighting the whispers , grunts , and other sounds during the dance numbers ? it ' s hard to care about these people if we can ' t even appreciate what they ' re capable of doing on - stage . berkley may have a future in hollywood because she can dance and she has a great body . after all , the world of porn is still an active , dishonourable profession . perhaps berkley could join their ranks and leave the real acting to pauly shore and cindy crawford . oops , they ' re bad actors , too . well , at least , they ' re not selfish and contemptable like good ol ' slutty nomi malone . useless trivia -- ironically , elizabeth berkley played virtuous and \" holier than thou \" jessie on the teeny - bopper tv show , \" saved by the bell \" , before breaking onto the big screen .", "the caveman ' s valentine starring samuel l . jackson , ann magnuson , aunjanue ellis , tamara tunie screenplay by george dawes green , based on his novel directed by kasi lemmons * * * for more film , dvd and books about movie reviews , plus annual coverage of the toronto international film festival , visit _film freak central_ - http : // filmfreakcentral . net | now with search engine * * * a strange mixture of _shine_ , _basquiat_ , _angel heart_ , and grant morrison & dave mckean ' s graphic novel \" arkham asylum \" , _the caveman ' s valentine_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman - cum - detective who , on the morning of february 14th , discovers a \" valentine \" just outside his new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald ' s strange fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree -- a young male model murdered and frozen to a branch . believing at first that his imagined nemesis stuyvesant , shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler building , is responsible for the murder , romulus ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant - garde photographer in the mapplethorpe mould , david leppenraub ( colm feore ) . his minor sleuthing interrupted by the occasional delusional fit and bouts with an ecstasy of creation ( romulus was a brilliant julliard - trained pianist prior to his psychosis ) , romulus uncovers clues and harasses suspects on his way to convincing his police - woman daughter ( aunjanue ellis ) that even though he ' s a nut , that doesn ' t mean that he can ' t solve a high - profile society murder . every moment an exhausting workshop of ideas , and every character the same , _the caveman ' s valentine_ is a concept so \" high concept \" that it suddenly became clear to me that the film fits into the comic book genre of entertainment , with romulus ' s \" caveman \" a slightly more mundane version of todd mcfarlane ' s urban noir hero , spawn . with a long - vanished wife ( tamara tunie ) acting as a spiritual guide , the occasional social caste commentary , the secret base in a cave , a divergent genius personality with a network of informants and supporters , and a wickedly colourful arch - enemy , the film piles on the lurid comic book details and dizzying slapdash colours to such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that the blue police cars weren ' t inscribed with \" gotham pd . \" that being said , _the caveman ' s valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart . the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman ' s valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane ' s spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts . it is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus ' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself . whether or not romulus of _the caveman ' s valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman ' s valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far . it , along with m . night shyamalan ' s _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller ' s seminal \" the dark knight returns \" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics . readers of sam keith ' s brilliant \" the maxx \" comic series ( or of mtv ' s short - lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne . the failure of both \" the maxx \" tv show and of _the caveman ' s valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america ' s surprising contributions to dark fantasy . luxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic - panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer ' s ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman ' s valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film . kasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve ' s bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering . _the caveman ' s valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape . clearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post - modern audience with urine - stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes . _the caveman ' s valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot ' s rat ' s alley wasteland .", "\" . . it ' s certainly more than just a monster story . . \" - kenneth branagh , director / actor / co - writer of mary shelley ' s frankenstein . kenneth branagh ' s new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein - films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale . the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful . but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story . horror - fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror . branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches . his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel . the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean . the year is 1794 . a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters . his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs . as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon . it ' s a man . exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew . his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown . the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773 . he is remembering his childhood and youth . laughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns . here victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony . this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed . like thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother . shocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death . standing on his mother ' s grave he says : \" oh mother . . you did not have to die . . . no one should ever die . . . i will stop this . . i promiss . . \" after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career . after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death . composing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally . with strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation . the result was ugliness . realizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late . the creature has escaped . because of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding . for a while everything is as it was before his mother ' s death . but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously . . . whale ' s picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel . brannagh has more or less done that . another thing is characters and actors . branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast . the greatest performances comes from de niro - the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro . alone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness . at first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love . later when he reads frankenstein ' s journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge . he is capable of killing without regret . \" i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground . . . . and then i slowly crushed his neck . . . and as i killed him , i saw your face . . \" that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator . and yet , he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable : \" for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all . \" rarely has a cinematic interpretation of \" the daemon \" approached the level of three - dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel . another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein . in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster ( god knows why ! ) with the power of an electrical storm . almost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel . here , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene . branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character . on the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past . helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein ' s surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart . the rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing . visually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) . the spinning camera , the constantly building - up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague - riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley ' s frankenstein is a wonder to behold . kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : \" . . all i once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by my hand . . \" . and the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator ' s body on fire . the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness . and a terrifying last close - up on the creature ' s smiling face . can a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ? to whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ? shelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them . following her example , branagh does the same . his film is a tragic saga about playing god . victor frankenstein is not an evil man . he wanted to change the world to the better . in this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions . produced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film \" dracula \" . in comparison , i can say that \" dracula \" has visuals that even \" frankenstein \" can not live up to . but when it comes to story , characters and casting , \" frankenstein \" is stronger . but stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan ' s \" interview with the vampire \" . although the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating . branagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly ' s classic novel .", "synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today ' s finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don ' t speak cinque ' s language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn ' t be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg ' s trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close - ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear - cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances .", "in one scene from \" the people vs . larry flynt , \" the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self - staged free speech rally . as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him , flynt strides confidently across the stage , delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity . the spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in \" patton \" where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag . both scenes were stirring , larger than life , richly entertaining , and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies . overall , that sums up \" the people vs . larry flynt . \" the film is a wildly entertaining hoot which , despite being based on fact , feels like a big , phony hollywood movie . the son of a kentucky moonshiner , flynt ( woody harrelson ) ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati . there he met althea leasure ( courtney love ) , a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life . to bolster interest in his clubs , he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine . flynt , along with the magazine ' s rag - tag management team , headed by his brother jimmy ( played nicely by woody ' s real - life brother , steak & shake commercial veteran brett harrelson ) , viewed playboy magazine with contempt . they mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos , striving to keep hustler focused on \" what guys really want , \" explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm , and extremely crude humor . the film ' s prime example of hustler ' s attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy , giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynt ' s \" naughtiness . \" director milos forman conveniently ignores the magazine ' s frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation , racism , and endless scatological cartoons . flynt ' s rag labored in well - deserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis , which brought the magazine international attention , big money and the attention of conservatives . an obscenity bust followed , the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law . lawyer alan isaacman ( edward norton ) enters the scene , hired by flynt ' s wife . norton , an exceptional actor , is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynt ' s increasingly childish and bizarre behavior . in court , we meet the sputtering conservatives , headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating ( james cromwell . ) as keating blathers about flynt ' s immorality , the camera slowly moves in for a close - up of his name tag , inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating , who was later convicted in a $ 2 billion s & l fraud . flynt ' s other prime foe is rev . jerry falwell , who sues over a hustler parody involving him and his mother having sex in an outhouse . tragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a would - be assassin , leaving him paralyzed from the waist down . a dark period follows , as flynt and leasure hole up in an l . a . suite , strung out on pain killers . flynt eventually kicks drugs , but leasure succumbs to addiction , and later , aids . after watch falwell on tv , describing aids as a punishment from god , flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court , leading to the film ' s climactic courtroom scene . \" the people vs , larry flynt \" is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech and lionizing flynt . \" if they ' ll protect a scumbag like me , then they ' ll protect all of you , \" declared flynt . he ' s right , of course , but the director forman cheats in portraying the opposition as little more than hypocritical buffoons . he also cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt . harrelson is an attractive , charismatic man , and his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero . even a cursory look at the real flynt , who is making the talk show circuit , and plays the judge in an early courtroom scene , shows a bloated , morose and bitter man . an accurate portrayal of flynt would have made a more difficult film to watch , but a richer one . despite its flaws , \" flynt \" is a fast moving , rousing movie with some terrific acting , especially by courtney love , whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod . the story may be candy -

( as gale ' s overly - chatty aunt recounts , her cordless was knicked into her ear and lodged in her brain . ) but these moments are not enough to sustain the movie . the pace sags , the dialogue drags and not much acting appears to be required of the telephone - touters . and the ending is literally a non - event as expected , everyone is too chicken to turn up for the party frank throws in gale ' s memory despite promising over the phone that they will . we get the point . the movie appears to be intent on flogging its terribly -' 90s statement until they have it coming out of your ears . pun intended . there ' s even a on the movie ' s web site where you can win cellular phones ( as if we haven ' t had enough of these things already ) . watch the movie only if you find it philosophy compelling enough for a earful . the flying inkpot ' s rating system : * wait for the video . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice .", "airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film - making . after all , it ' s brought to us by one of the best known satire writing / directing teams . even if most people don ' t recognize the names behind the films , they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! , top secret , the naked gun , and hot shots to name a few . but although the zucker / abrahams / zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 , airplane ! remains the true cornerstone of their work , and their directorial debuts . in the seventies , disaster films seemed to be at an all time high . films like earthquake , the towering inferno , and the poseidon adventure were big hits . there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade . and so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film . this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean . . . it had to do with bad fish . airplane ! is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex - fighter - pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrades . unable to stop living in the past , ted ' s world fell apart . he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty ) . in a desperate attempt not to lose her , ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working . unfortunately , she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her , which leaves him wallowing in self - pity . in the midst of it all , something happens . someone gets sick . then another . then another . soon , the whole plane is full of deathly - ill chicago - bound people . . . and when the pilots get sick ( played by peter graves , kareem abdul - jabbar , and frank ashmore ) , who will save the day ? ( gee , i wonder ) of course the main draw here is the non - stop \" whiz - bang \" comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags . although i had seen this movie a few times before , i was still laughing thru the entire thing . the most fun character by far is the doctor , played by leslie nielsen . he ' s a dry , subtle , sterotypically straight - faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film . in a film like this , you ' re not really expecting an elaborate production , so one can ' t complain about the amateurish quality . what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker . this character is pointless , nauseating , and very unfunny . i don ' t know why he was put in there , and i don ' t think anybody will find a good excuse . and when the film nears an end , it slows down quite a bit , almost getting old . you gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long . aside from that , airplane ! is really a top - notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic . it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends , especially if they haven ' t seen it . and if they ask what the plot is , just tell ' em \" it ' s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film , but that ' s not important right now . \" if you ' ve seen the film , you ' ll understand ; - )", "numerous comparisons can be made with this movie to past sci - fi , suspense thrillers . soldier is a multi ? crossbreed between the likes of terminator , aliens and offspring . the problem with such mixed genes is that the final product is a real mongrel ? not well made and should have been put down before production got off the ground . besides this , the action is mediocre when compared to the standard action flicks of this day and age . the fight scenes between jason scott lee and kurt russell seem laboured , slow and sluggish , and could have done with better choreography . russell who is usually a good actor in b - grade action flicks is unusually hampered by his character ? sergeant todd , who seems more like a sergeant toad . besides having almost no dialogue , his character appears stunted , zombie - like which is in line with his screen persona , but scores little points of empathy with the audience . this movie has not made me change my opinion about director paul anderson , whose last epic event horizon has left an unusually bitter taste in my mouth . although this movie does not come anywhere close to the strangeness of former , it is still a long way from anything considered desirable .", "this is crap , but , honestly , what older american audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon and james garner as bicker - ing ex - presidents ? especially when their supporting players in - clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief , lauren bacall as a former first lady , and john heard as the dan quayle - ish vice president . yup , you ' re talkin ' pre - sold property here and , for warner brothers , the perfect fit into their now - ritual grumpy old men holiday slot . for the non - discriminating viewer , my fellow americans is fine . the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political - thriller road - comedy . ( they did in mine , heaven help us . ) for the rest of us , the movie is immediately tiresome . the tone is terrible and the banter is worse . forget wit -- lemmon and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie . ( has anyone counted the number of first penis references ? ) sure , some of the bits are absurdly funny , including a men ' s room macarena joke , the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels , and an all dorothy marching band performing \" over the rainbow \" at a gay men ' s march . the get there from here , though , you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores of all time . judas priest , is there a single moment of silence in this film ? even the dialogue gets drowned out . what a waste .", "come on hollywood , surprise me . stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue , sketchy characters and plots as predictable as the sunset . the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls . personal , because his niece is one of the victims . it ' s a slobbering psychopath , of course , but this time there ' s a twist . freeman notes that each of the young women who ' ve disappeared are all strong willed , assertive , and more successful in their careers than the average girl . we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova , whose aim is to \" dominate \" these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon and keeping them as his personal harem . anyway , one of the women manages to escape ( ashly judd ) and teams up with freeman to . . . well , you know the rest . a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs , with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants , may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable story . perhaps , but that film also has superbly drawn characters and smart dialogue . so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further , okay ? and as for comparisons to seven . . . oh please ! kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson and written for the screen by one david klass . maybe the novel was a stinker to start with , but whatever the case , it ' s the writing that ' s clearly at fault here . one , these characters have very little to say that ' s engaging or interesting . two , the script has no sense of humour . three , while the notion of a psycho ' s victims being smart , successful women is an interesting twist , the execution isn ' t even half as good as the idea . thus , ashly judd comes across all out of focus , instead of being the heart of the story . we can ' t feel her rage . some atrociously written casual exchanges between her and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she ' s the no - bullshit 90 ' s type , but these conversations barely register . and as for freeman , kiss the girls is his second dog in a year : first chain reaction , now this . for an actor of his calibre , this is most worrying . young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction - esque things to do in denver when your dead . but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this ? not much , and you can hardly blame him . there ' s a few well - staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls , dives and jumps , and the effect is startling . but the script is beyond rescue . what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe , safe in the knowledge that jaded audiences will lap it up . complacency rules : it ' s been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters , real surprises and consistently sharp dialogue . the only consolation for this viewer is that my ticket to the movie was a freebie , positive proof that the best things in life aren ' t free . . . . .", "perhaps it ' s time for me to say a little about my reading habits . i really do like to read , and i ' ve enjoyed many books in my lifetime . my problem is that i ' m a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i ' ll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it ' s taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i ' m loving the book ) . in addition to this , i typically don ' t read anything created after the 19th century . the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven ' t read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations ) . however , i don ' t think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film . needless to say , i haven ' t read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh ' s new film is based . i can ' t say how faithful of an adaptation it is , or if it lives up to leonard ' s vision . i can say that it ' s a terrific film , with sharp acting , great dialogue , and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh . it ' s certainly a nice distraction from 1998 ' s lineup of brainless blockbusters , all hopelessly wishing that size mattered . out of sight proves that it doesn ' t . i had originally written george clooney off as a one - note actor , incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair . after seeing his latest performance in this film , i ' ve changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $ 20 million superstars . here , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living . he does it because it ' s fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won ' t start . he goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames ) . we ' re then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u . s . marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes . fortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety . the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another , though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible . we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence ( and , since this is a gritty crime comedy , flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise ) . at first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too . it ' s a fun gimmick , though , and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally . i ' ve only seen a few of soderbergh ' s films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he ' s excellent at what he does . he ' s an artist without making it obvious , and without being pretentious , which is always admirable . he uses tricks , yes ( lots of freeze - frame stuff here ) , but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film . as i said , clooney is terrific , and he ' s matched by lopez . lopez is , of course , beautiful , but she can act , too . i can sense that she ' s honing in on her skills , for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u - turn ) . the two actors have arresting chemistry with one another -- the best scene in the film , by far , is the seduction scene . the brilliance of this scene is also due , in part , to soderbergh , for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later . the scene is a series of soft nuances and glances , layered upon light dialogue , and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema -- meaningful and engrossing . the supporting cast is strong , led by the always - reliable ving rhames . dennis farina , who plays karen ' s father , is good , as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain . steve zahn , who plays jack ' s nearly - brain dead accomplice glenn , steals all of his scenes ( and that ' s in a film where every scene is already at a high level ) . all of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently - constructed script by scott frank . out of sight is certainly a light film , although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory . overall , i can recommend it simply as great entertainment . not every film has to change your life , and it ' s nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers . as for the book , this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at .", "the haunting , a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film : to scare us . if you ' ve ever seen a movie , which you probably have considering you are on this website , you should know about all of the trivia they post before a movie . they have things like illustrations and you have to guess the movie or facts about the film . but , the one i always like are the & quot ; other name & quot ; joke that try and rename a particular film . for instance , the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film , small soldiers . they had titles like little infantry and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size ? well , after seeing the haunting , i had a few particular names for it as well . unfortunately , i can only post one of them , otherwise , i ' d be getting some pretty angry e - mails from overprotective mothers . that title would be the confusing . ok , that is a pretty bad title , but it fits this film perfectly . it basically serves up no purpose , and combined with dry dialogue and a boring and confusing plot , it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb . liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth , but at least the phantom menace was exciting and had some depth . the haunting is nothing but trash , but unfortunately , will still make a boatload of money . before i rant and rave about how bad this film is , let me point out the few , and i stress the word few , bright spots in this film . first , the house is great - looking . it looks beautiful , but this is also a dark spot . it looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it . this is something that rears its ugly head at all points of the film . things look so great , that you are looking on in awe instead of being scared straight . haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly successful and that is being eerie . the hill house is not eerie . it is beautiful , but not the least bit frightening . ever heard of lili taylor ? before this film i did not , but i am glad that i do now . she gives the only satisfactory performance in the film . despite the dry dialogue and boring / confusing concept , she manages to light up the screen every time she appears , but unfortunately , her co - stars are usually following right behind . owen wilson , who plays luke , is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance , other then taylor . he is basically there for the comic relief , and his character development is poor in all other areas . all of the characters are desperately underdeveloped . wilson had potential as luke , but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs . liam neeson and catherine zeta - jones suffer from the dialogue and plot and should not have been in this film . their characters must suffer from wicked mood swings because in each scene they turn from ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave and whatnot . they just are not believable and this is the final nail in the haunting ' s coffin . the plot is terrible . the opening scene of the film is very important , but the director makes it too obvious by getting close - ups of all the things that will play a major role in the end of the film . as i sat through the film , i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish . nell , lili taylor ' s character , goes from the hunted to the savior . it makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film . he forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any in - depth information . for instance , the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program . but , we get zilch for the other four . plus , two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes . and the worst part : most horror films have killings . for some reason , they kill off luke at the end of the film . no reason whatsoever , just off with his head , literally . overall , the haunting is the epitome of a bad movie . bad plot , confusing storyline and a waste of good talent . hopefully , liam neeson can rebound and get into a good film and be used to his full potential . hopefully , lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a great job in such a bad film . and hopefully , other horror films , such as the blair witch project and the haunting of hill house , will not be as bad as this one .", "the booming introduction music finishes , and the camera sweeps over red mountains . we see two figures looking over a barren , and very red landscape . they kiss , then walk on . one of the characters ( schwarzenegger ) slips , and falls . the glass on his mask cracks . his face scruches up , and his eye ' s begin to pop . . . . . then doug quaid , played by schwarzenegger , wakes up . it ' s all been a dream . he wakes up next to his beautiful wife , played by stone , and the film begins . . . total recall is a typical sci - fi film wrapped around an intresting ( if far fetched ) plot . quaid , who has never been to mars , keeps on having dreams of the planet , which has now been colanised . one day , while riding on a train , he ' s see ' s a ad for a company called ' rekall ' , which implants memories of a holiday , instead of you actually going there yourself . quaid chooses the ' secret agent on mars ' memory , and then the s * * * really hits the fan . the implant goes wrong , and quaid really thinks he is an agent on mars for about two minutes , until he goes back to normal and can ' t remember a thing . however , everyone he knows ( his workmates , his wife ) turn against him , saying how ' blabbed about mars ' and ' blew his cover on the mission ' a strange man , called richter , played by ironside , wants to kill him . quaid , now hopelessly confused , follows the advice given to him , by a ' friend ' . he get ' s his ass to mars . mars is ruled by cohagen , played by cox , who charges people for air . against him are the rebels , who are mainly mutants . the rebel ' s need quaid to defeat cohagen , because quaid knows ( but can ' t remember yet ) about a reactor that produces air . eventually , quaid kills cohagen , turns on the reactor , saves the planet , and goes away with a beautiful girl , just like the guy at rekall promised him . throughout this plot , there is huge explosions , thousands of deaths ( and i mean a lot of death ) swearing , sex , and everything else that make ' s a good verhoeven ( director of basic instinct and starship troopers ) movie . naturally , there ' s some pretty imaginative deaths , with arms getting ripped off , someone getting drilled , and heads exploding . as you can tell , it ' s violent stuff . but it ' s done so stylishly , and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner , that ' s it excusable . the acting is variable . arnie , of course , is useless , but he goes has some good lines , and in the first twenty minutes , he even act ' s like a normal bloke , not like some action hero . stone , of course , is useless , making a pretty poor wife , and a pretty poor action hero . but , she does sex scenes alright . ticoton ( most recently seen in con air ) , again , is ok , doing some good action , but getting her emotions all wrong . one minute she hates quaid , the next she loves him , and she never gets this tranisition right . so , the good guys are awful . but , the bad guy ' s are excellent . cox is basically reprising robocop , but he ' s still great in this , and he delivers the best line in the whole film near the end . ironside is superbly evil , with an utterly emotionless face . the supporting cast are fine , and not even the comedy sidekick ( this time in the form of a taxi driver ) is annoying . one disappointing aspect , though , are the special effects . ilm and dreamquest do some good work ( such as a subway station scene ) but the model work is not so good . some of the model heads look appaling fake , and quatto is a major disappointment . another irritating thing is the product placement . there are a lot of plugs ( and a good mars today gag ) however , the sets look great , and the special effects at the end of the film aren ' t too bad either . there ' s also a good soundtrack running through , by jerry goldsmith ( the omen , poltergeist , star trek : the motion picture ) overall , then , total recall is a hugely violent , yet hugely enjoyable , action fest , with a reasonable plot thrown in there too , some great bad guys , and some imaganitive death . for a schwarzenegger movie , this is not bad at all . in fact , it ' s very good .", "\" through a spyglass , i could see everything . \" king louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 , 1793 , but instead of visualizing this act of regicide , legendary auteur eric rohmer ' s the lady and the duke observes from afar . consider it a view to a kill made abstract . a proper british ( yes , british ) gentlewoman , grace elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants . the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope ( often muttering , \" i don ' t know , \" ) as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air . what we don ' t see might not be able to hurt us . just close your eyes and think of england . during times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them . adapted from elliott ' s memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer ' s latest artistic tour - de - force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc . ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history . resisting the temptation for grand - scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along . a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace ' s life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king ' s hot - blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean - claude dreyfus ) . the times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence . during the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke ' s sister - in - law on a stake . rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob . in doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death . when grace sees her friend ' s disembodied head on a pole , rohmer ' s attention drifts from the societal change to one woman ' s reaction shot , laden with hot tears . grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob . through her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist ' s escape . grace doesn ' t even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger ) . she endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence . maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance . the events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values . aristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones . the duke is called to vote on the king ' s punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction ) . the episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification . lazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke . that ' s foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer ' s characters occasionally become didactic . rohmer ' s imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future . what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer ' s use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism . the actors were filmed against a bluescreen , then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris . this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot , a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide - open streets . it looks as phony as titanic , but unlike james cameron ' s debacle , the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone . why ? they aren ' t real . the very foundation rohmer ' s characters stand upon is false , and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves , in all their insubstantial glory . screened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) .", "john carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has it ' s good side and it ' s bad . it ' s held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending that ' s pretty satisfying . james woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie . the good side : some neat scenes of vampires and violence . the bad : no scares . yes that ' s right , even though being directed by one of horror ' s most cherished directors , ' vampires ' is the least bit scary , if not at all . james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the ' master ' vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight . daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya , a wise - cracking guy who really isn ' t that funny . in the opening scene jack along with montoya and the team of vampire hunters , find an abandoned house to which vampire occupy . of course we all know sunshine kills vampires , and that is just how they kill these vampires : hooking them to ropes and dragging them outside letting them burn to death . after throwing a party for what happened , the vampires that did not die come back to trash it . they kill almost all of jack ' s team , leaving only a few alive . sheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek , but not yet turned into a vampire . she is rescued by jack and ? flees with them on their search for valek . they have to fight they ' re way against vampires , leading up to a finale that is well - done with great special effects . ' vampires ' definately could have been done better . the make - up , special effects and story are first rate , but there is no scares or terror that the film could have had . it to me had more humor than horror , almost being compared to ' fright night ' with the mix of violence and comedy . john carpenter does a great job of directing this film . he eases through some tough times and saves the flaws , which are noticeable but forgettable . the script is clever and funny , with many lines that make us laugh out loud . i much enjoyed ' vampires ' with a few exceptions . it ' s one of those films you see but don ' t take to heart . you enjoy the time you spent and go on . the recently released ' psycho ' is the same way , it ' s not as good as you ' d hope but it is fun and entertaining . ' vampires ' is a good horror flick with no scares but plenty of other content to please the viewer .", "jacques tati ' s 1953 classic \" les vacances de m . hulot \" ( also known as \" mr . hulot ' s vacation , \" in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film . the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week ' s vacation . yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory . part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags . slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face - first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don ' t watch where they ' re going . in \" les vacances de m . hulot , \" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low - key . in one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat . while crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it . when he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues . tati doesn ' t waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film . it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience ' s expectations , and \" les vacances de m . hulot \" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well . tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement . when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark . tati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , \" oh , he ' s not going to do that again , \" but , lo and behold , he does . for example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot ' s noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel ' s lights coming on one by one . then this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce . the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four - star film as opposed to merely an above - average , clever comedy . as much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did . the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters . it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons . instead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem . \" les vacances de m . hulot \" is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events . anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store . note : \" les vacances de m . hulot \" was not rated by the mpaa . it would at most receive a pg rating .", "` we run tings . tings don ' t run we .

styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . capone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . when he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn ' t as hyperkinetic as most of woo ' s films are . the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . the make - up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . paul campbell , as the ` loose cannon ' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part - time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . unfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . the end credit song , ` we run tings ' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . oddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of ` gangsta ' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn ' t contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . at the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six - month box - office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $ 21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $ 500 , 000 us ) . palm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six - string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . chris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box - office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i ' d say he has a pretty good track record . overall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . if action films are your thing and you don ' t mind intermittent subtitles , then you can ' t go wrong with this film . the performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . i ' m not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop ' s honors are well deserved .", "american pie acknowledges a cold , hard fact that most movies don ' t : it is very difficult to get laid . its four virgin heroes are jim ( biggs ) , a chronic masturbator , kev ( nicholas ) , who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend ( reid ) , oz ( klein ) , a lacrosse player whose approach requires some fine tuning , and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) , a germphobe ( his crass nickname is hilarious , but i won ' t spoil it here ) who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member . jim , kev , oz and finch attend a high school in suburban michigan full of so many impossibly beautiful women it ' s no wonder they ' re horny all the time . after a party at their studly friend stifler ' s ( seann william scott , in the film ' s sharpest performance ) house leaves them sexually unsatisfied , the quartet make a pact : to \" lose it \" by graduation - specifically , prom night , which is only a few weeks away . american pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds . almost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin ' whoopee . all women are there to be ogled . ( alyson hannigan ' s perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch . ) situations abound that defy logic only to arouse and / or amuse its core audience , adolescent boys . ( to arouse : nadia ' s ( shannon elizabeth ) internet striptease - an unexpectedly raucous ( and guiltily pleasurable ) sequence . to amuse : jim ' s lusty encounter with a hot apple pie . ) what differentiates american pie from those dirty eighties comedies , aside from a very nineties obsession with bodily fluids * , is a cast that ' s light years more appealing than that of , say , just one of the guys . two more standouts : klein and \" sctv \" ' s eugene levy . klein plays a kind - hearted athlete for the second time in a row , after alexander payne ' s underappreciated election . i hope to see more of this warm actor with the disarmingly honest face very soon . levy ' s is the most crowd - pleasing performance , and indeed , it ' s nice to see him back on the big screen in a role that makes wonderful use of that expressive brow . american pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents _would_ let you watch growing up . it skillfully employs a broad mix of pop tunes , much like john hughes ' movies did , and even pays homage to the breakfast club a couple of times , most evidently when the prom band covers simple minds ' \" don ' t you ( forget about me ) . \" the picture ultimately has a healthy , if obligatory , attitude towards safe sex - even at their most libidinous , american pie ' s protagonists first whip out a condom . the filmmakers prove that socially responsible raunch is possible . for its familiarity and for its charming leads , i recommend american pie , but the buzz on this film had me expecting something . . . fresher . as far as the new teen cinema goes , it ' s at the top of the heap . * don ' t say i didn ' t warn you about the party scene .", "when i saw the trailer for \" the sixth sense , \" i didn ' t expect much from it . my snap judgment was that it was a watered - down version of \" the shining \" or possibly a late - entry in the glut of angel - related movies / tv shows of a couple years ago . but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot . it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year . bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe . at the beginning of the movie , he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work , but he is soon confronted by vincent , a patient malcolm failed years earlier ( donnie wahlberg - former new kid - in an impressive cameo ) . a year passes , and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed . cole sear ( haley joel osment ) is a withdrawn kid who is called \" freak \" by the other boys in the neighborhood . weird things seem to happen around cole - his mother ( olivia williams ) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn ' t moved - and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn ' t - for example , that there was once a gallows in his school . he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom . the trailer gave away the movie ' s first major plot twist . if it hadn ' t , the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn ' t know what ' s wrong with cole . if you ' re lucky enough to have not seen the trailer , stop reading this review right now and go see \" the sixth sense . \" anyway , since the trailer gave it away , i figure it ' s fair game to discuss here . once malcolm gains cole ' s trust , cole reveals his secret : he sees ghosts everywhere . dead people wander around not knowing that they ' re dead , invisible to everyone except cole . malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth . the box office success of \" the sixth sense \" has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that ' s so . i hate to burst anybody ' s bubble , but \" the sixth sense \" isn ' t really a horror film . at its core , \" the sixth sense \" is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally - scarred adult help each other to move past their problems . some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy , though . one that really got to me : the ghost of a boy says to cole , \" i ' ll show you where my dad keeps his gun \" ; when the ghost turns , we see the bullet wound in the back of his head . osment gives the best performance i ' ve ever seen from a child actor . it ' s hard enough to find a grown - up in hollywood who can give a subtle , realistic portrayal ! although willis gets top billing , cole is really the protagonist of the story , and osment truly brings the complex kid to life . if only willis ' work were as impressive . accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue , willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm , his most challenging role to date . ( this is a bad omen for his next movie , \" the story of us , \" which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage ) . writer / director m . night shyamalan has a light , poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite . he ' s also a skillful storyteller , as the movie ' s ending demonstrates . only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie . look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole . bottom line : osment should get an oscar nomination , and you should go see this movie .", "one of these days , i ' ll make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie . king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding ( and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single , emotive viewing ) , his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art - house trappings . it ' s a perfume - drenched , coke - addled visit to the seedy pornography shop , where beautiful models ( no , hookers -- no , courtesans ) usher you through the silk curtains . ferrara ' s only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again , since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever he ' s onscreen . his 8 - minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal , unwatchable , and pretentious failure . when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements , or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch , there ' s a much - needed dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair . you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know they ' re actually having fun ? the addiction is that movie . walken , sadly , does not appear in the blackout . the central role of matty , a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction , is played by matthew modine ( who takes what he can get after cutthroat island ) . much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonioni ' s terminally bored cultural elite , matty is involved in a bitter pill \" relationship \" with high fashioned model annie ( at least i think she ' s a model . ) matty ' s lady is played by french actress b ? atrice dalle , arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout -- not that you needed to know that , but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara ' s entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout . no kidding . requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara ' s movies and his controversial urban lifestyle . matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him . no doubt , he was off chasing the dragon . in his despair , matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery , tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne ( dennis hopper , in full \" dirty ol ' man \" mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs . wider ! ) toward the end of the night , they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie ( sarah lassez ) , start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene , then matty thankfully blacks out . something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie , and it ' s exactly what you think it was . suffice to say , there ' s some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two , or anyone at all . the blackout is typical ferrara : no plot to speak of , plenty of raunch , and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see - through curtain in his hotel room by the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea . cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu - style sleaze ( and we ' re back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits . \" yeah ! ! ! yeah ! ! ! arrrghhh ! \" says mr . hopper . dirty old sod . ) it ' s compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way , leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny . how ' s that for cryptic ? never fear -- ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he ' s all about . i can picture it now . \" take off yer clothes , kid -- it ' s essential to depict the inner maelstrom of my central protagonist , and you ' re his visual id . you ' re the soul , the heart , the bloodstream of the picture . take it off ! take it all off ! ! ! ha ha ha ! \" friggin ' vampire . yeah , you , ferrara . a final word about matthew modine : he ' s actually a fine actor when properly cast , but there ' s something too squeaky - clean in his demeanor . he ' s ideally suited for sarcastic men in tightly controlled situations , such as his private joker in full metal jacket or the time - bomb nebbish in short cuts ( who is every bit as superb as julianne moore in that famous scene , though no one seems to notice him ) . [ he was in that scene ? - ed . ] here , he ' s asked to let it all hang out , sporting a three - day stubble and oily bangs . he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski , but it ' s somehow lacking . modine lacks the feral intensity of brando , entirely miscast in ferrara ' s flesh fair . better luck next time , matt . someday , you ' ll be forgiven for cutthroat island , which wasn ' t really your fault in the first place . maybe atom egoyan will find a place for you somewhere , and all will once again be well in your world .", "the great actor james woods once said ( and i ' m paraphrasing ) , \" if sex isn ' t messy , then you ' re not doing it right \" . a truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace \" sex \" with \" your mad slasher film \" ) . for those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub - genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween . urban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special . for film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright - free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) \" if you can ' t scare your audience , gross em ' out , if you can ' t do that , make em ' laugh \" . alas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention . i actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $ 40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it . it seems that audiences ' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt . the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them . unfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super - hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don ' t need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering . if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla . but forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off - shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced ) . allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation . these flicks aren ' t harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ? sadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while . and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three . despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes . as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend ' s setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer . you see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface . all those young people are growing up together , going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness is expected . all the better for that elusive crazed killer . coupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around , and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task . but alas , urban legend is not only idiotic and clich ? ? full ; it ' s way too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore , and much stupidity . this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , i dunno , exercise . it ' s the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running - like - the - wind - prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques . it ' s the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack . i really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud - noise - jump - scare thing . yes the audience jumps , momentarily frightened , but wouldn ' t anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room . i lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer . apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers . in scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man ' s rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) , and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody : the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( ooh ? ? ? scary ) intended to conceal his / her identity . for urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume . though i must admit , urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film . the film ' s killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends ( you know , like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they ' re coming from inside the house ) . i won ' t spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used , after all the film does offer fine 2 : 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough . sad to say , it doesn ' t include my favorite urban legend : a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil . now that would be scary . before i leave you , i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film ( the first being the lack of craft , the second the lack of exploitation ) -- its characters , all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i ' ve ever spent an evening with . only jared leto ( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day ) and alicia witt , as the resilient heroine , avoid vexatiousness . the most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum , as a supremely irritating lout ( so irritating i actually cheered his painful death , and i am not a cruel person ) . ironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film ; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining . after all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can ' t stand getting slaughtered , which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i can ' t stand not getting slaughtered .", "at first glance , daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie . on second glance it looks that way too . although , as typical disaster movies go , daylight isn ' t that bad . admittedly , it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by ( think poseidon adventure ) . but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the \" haven ' t i seen this scene somewhere before ? \" feeling that creeps up all too often during the film . sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york ' s emergency response team . by sheer luck , he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film . \" what disaster is that ? \" you ask , as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat . glad you asked . through a whole sequence of entirely probable events ( about as probable as hitting the lottery ) a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city . the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends , which causes not only massive loss of life , but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel . good old sly , who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses , offers his services to the rescuers , who gladly accept it . sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft ( think judge dredd ) which he can only go in , and not out off , and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside . so begins the fun , but the fun has to be quick , because this tunnel has started to spring a leak . the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie . not superb by any means , but far above some of his other films ( think judge dredd again ) . daylight ' s acting is probably average , or a little above , in terms of this sort of genre , starring this particular star . amy brenneman is the only actor of any note , and she does a pretty good job as stallone ' s reluctant helper . oh yeah , stallone ' s real life son , sage , is in this too . sage -- nice name . i guess it could be worse , he could have been named nutmeg or parsley . note to sage -- you are still young . go to school and get a good education -- you don ' t have a future in acting . the plot runs along the same lines as the acting -- interesting , but predictable . mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks . the biggest problem with a film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movie . as soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle , another one seems to pop right up , even worse than the last one . i realize that it wouldn ' t be much of a movie otherwise , but it does make the movie a bit predictable . adding to the predictability is the cast of characters , which of course , has to include at least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way and think the qualified guy ( in this case stallone ) doesn ' t know what he is doing . why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other and all work together ? would this be too much to ask ? can ' t we all just get along ? special effects weren ' t bad -- but i ' ve certainly seen better . some of the scenes , while fun to watch , were such blatant rip - offs that you had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim . especially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater ( the tunnel , of course , starts to flood ) . i really expected gene hackman , roddy mcdowell and ernest borgnine to appear at any minute -- i wasn ' t sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure . i suppose if you have to rip off a movie for good ideas , the poseidon adventure is a good one to use . the underwater sequences ( aside from the deja vu ) were very well shot and worked fairly well . they were the best part of the movie by a long shot . better than average stallone flick . i realize that ' s not saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume . but certainly not up to the standards of cliffhanger . daylight is a fun movie , and as long as you aren ' t expecting a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised .", "in 1994 , an insider ' s look at a scandal - ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton ' s 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship ) . now , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever . but the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president . it is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics . jack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination . he is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) . the film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton ' s ideals and helps to organize the campaign . he joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) . governor stanton ' s past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage . to help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend , libby \" the dustbuster \" holden ( kathy bates ) . the acting throughout primary colors is superb . it would be worth seeing the movie for bates ' wild performance alone . she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance . travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little . emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can ' t let anything show that might hurt the presidential run . the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom . primary colors treads lightly on this issue . though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues . in fact , most of the \" bad guys \" are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house . rather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control . although the film strays into some obviously non - clinton territory , it is difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president ' s current troubles ) . primary colors ' chief problem is its length . it runs about 15 minutes too long . there are some scenes which could have easily been cut . for example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists . the scene ' s only apparent purpose is to establish stanton ' s character , which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film . the extra length isn ' t long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying , but it mars an otherwise excellent film . republicans , democrats , and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors . it ' s a funny , and at some times shocking , look at the modern political process .", "the summer of 00 ' wasn ' t a very good one for devout cinephiles . it offered no blair witches or sixth senses ; the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x - men adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update . nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season , that battery - charging ( at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o ' shit that moseys into multiplexes ) time of year when all those oscar contenders ( read : \" quality \" films ) compete for

from a script he has not written , and he seems unsure of how to handle the material . betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction ( this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and

left me cold with its calculated desperation . it ' s labute ' s half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesn ' t even seem to have half that heart in it . nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict , betty ( brilliantly played by renee zellweger ) , who witnesses the killing of her husband , del ( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife ) by two hit men ( morgan freeman and chris rock ) . she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities . she ' s blocked out her husband ' s death and thinks she ' s a character in her favorite soap , a reason to love . betty sets out on the road to la ( with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk ) searching for her soap boyfriend dr . david ravell ( greg kinnear ) while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit . the labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men , slipped a bit ( but not much ) with his sophomore effort , your friends and neighbors , then fell straight on his ass with bash , a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime . the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist , only labute ' s persistence in wallowing in the horrid things \" average \" people do to each other , usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are . in the play , paul rudd , as an obnoxious jock , delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death , while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim \" boys will be boys \" . another character , schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby ! what was once so powerful about labute ' s work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic . obviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty isn ' t it . he clearly has little passion for what he ' s doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn ' t managed to transcend that ) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience . nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down , as the two are made to enact soft - boiled tarantino - esque dialogue . they evince little chemistry , with rock constantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that ' s represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) . i think rock is a great comic yet he hasn ' t been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it ' s like he ' s doing the damn chris rock show . surprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks . that wide - open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty - year - old body . it ' s the best work she ' s ever done . freeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it . the actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty ' s , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality . that ' s interesting but the movie doesn ' t do anything with it other than crash land the sub - theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle . the film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie ' s in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it ' s parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing . the film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke . betty ' s screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty wouldn ' t make any progress in the film . nurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim ' s wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim ' s girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ? a little too tidy , don ' tcha think . betty has an interesting theme , though it doesn ' t even seem aware of this . the current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way . this is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real - life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) . instead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the ' 80s than the ' 00s ) , the film simply uses betty ' s delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b . no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation .", "marie ( charlotte rampling , \" aberdeen \" ) and jean ( bruno cremet , \" sorcerer \"

insisting that this is not her husband . \" under the sand \" is a character study and melancholy portrait of aging ( ' i ' ve lost my youth , ' marie declares ) and loss . charlotte rampling , given the chance to portray an older , yet still sexual , woman runs with it , bringing us into the mind of the character . her chemistry with bruno cremet is startlingly natural . as marie returns from her first date with vincent , she sits on the couch with jean .

( note : since smith co - executive produced good will hunting , it ' s not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . ) director gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes . there ' s an edginess to some of the sean / will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will / skylar relationship is electric . likewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie ' s friendship . many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic . matt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will . minnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it ' s refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) . the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber . arguably the best dramatic work in the actor ' s career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams ' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination . adequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) . like most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren ' t always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail . good will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the \" good \" in the title .", "\" the 44 caliber killer has struck again . \" starring john leguizamo , mira sorvino , adrian brody , jennifer esposito , michael rispoli , bebe neuwirth . rated r . summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee ' s abilities . lee is a great filmmaker , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg . but here , he gets himself into a bind . his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work . the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city . it was the hottest summer on record . to boot , new york ' s first serial killer was on the loose : calling himself the son of sam , david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population . so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout , people went berserk , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city . the movie ' s focus is on a group of twenty - somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club - hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters . we follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings . vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her . ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more \" eccentric , \" and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend . tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam ' s first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again . a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects . at the top of the list is ritchie . vinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend . as we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic , the dreaded \" so what ? \" question springs to mind . from the way this movie is made , i ' d have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find . lee touches on so much -- the media , the 70 ' s punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters ' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn ' t bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement . all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable . too bad summer of sam doesn ' t get any help here . frankly , it ' s a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn ' t entertain beyond its first half hour . there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague . leguizamo ' s turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny . the script makes it clear that we ' re supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy . you ' d never guess from his performance . adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better . sorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i ' m tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true - to - heart . brody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for . summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it ' s pretty well directed , in a purely technical way . but it ' s also empty , pretentious and boring . like last year ' s the thin red line , it ' s a movie by a director who doesn ' t know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway . ? 1999 eugene novikov &# 137 ;", "so much for sweet returns . after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80 ' s slasher movies , starting with 1996 ' s \" scream , \" and followed by \" scream 2 , \" \" urban legend , \" and the original , \" i know what you did last summer , \" a film like , \" i still know what you did last summer , \" was bound to be made sooner or late . it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out , and that is because they reached for the lowest - common - denominator in filmmaking , favoring non - stop deaths and gore for suspense , and trading in fleshed out , likable characters for one - dimensional nitwits . it has been exactly one year since julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis , a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road , and then , thinking he was dead , dumped him into the ocean . since then , julie has relocated to boston university , and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams , she has been able to put her life back together . when julie ' s friend , karla ( brandy ) , is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is , she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people , which also includes karla ' s horny boyfriend , tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend , ray ( freddie prinze jr . , also returning from the original ) , doesn ' t show up . when they reach the secluded island , they discover it is the last day of the open season , and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them . of course , julie , her friends , and the workers aren ' t the only ones there , as the murderous ben willis , dressed in fisherman garb , returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all . it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like , \" i still know what you did last summer , \" is made . i am a very big fan of horror movies , and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to \" ikwydls , \" which i am a fan of , is almost an exact replica of a \" friday the 13th \" movie . while the original focused more on the story and characters , as well as genuinely suspenseful moments , thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson ( who didn ' t return to write the sequel , and it shows ) , \" i still know . . . \" has no story to speak of , and is so vacuous of ideas , that the filmmakers , were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested . also gone are any signs of character development , and since every single character died before i got to know them , all i was left with was to stare at the screen , indifferent to what was going on . while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original , it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died . they were all paper - thin and pointless , except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman . another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set - pieces , like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar , but there are none to speak of in this sequel ( although they do come close at one moment with brandy ) . since so many people were killed every couple minutes , the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water . also of note is the mystery of the second killer , and accomplice to ben , but it is obvious from the first frame who it is , and so i couldn ' t even have fun at that , like i did in the \" scream \" movies and , \" urban legend . \" it figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again , a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else . maybe the people who made , \" i still know what you did last summer , \" should have realized that in order to make a good movie , you must have a screenplay --- or at least one that isn ' t such a black hole for thoughts and ideas . the ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part , but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel , everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead .", "i ' ve noticed something lately that i ' ve never thought of before . pseudo - substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films . have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ? more and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff . i ' m not trying to say city of angels is that bad . it had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered . somehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography . the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment . but for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time . nicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life . meg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we ' re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive . after losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient ' s transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor . he begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday . angels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire . seth ' s adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community . the angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it ' s a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness . cage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face / off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once . it ' s nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire . the two aren ' t very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual \" intelligently ditzy \" romantic comedy roles , and it ' s an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy . but even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye . it ' s a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn ' t know quite how to get to it . they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high . filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60 + minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths . based on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending . most movie goers , the non - cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized . nonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories .", "i think of i know what you did last summer as the movie that scream and scream 2 could have been . mind you , though , i mean this in the worst possible way . i know what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the scream ' s . as a result , it ' s even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures ( see nightmare on elm street ) because it thinks it ' s about thirty times smarter than it is . based on a teen book of the same name and , disappointingly , adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson , i know what you did last summer begins with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with some startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean and an angsty sort sitting at the top . the appropriate mood being set ( this is angst - horror for the 90 ' s ) , we cut over to the july 4th parade in a small north carolina town . from there , we see the blond , female protagonist , helen shivers ( woodenly played by sarah michelle geller ) , getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male \" hero , \" barry cox ( woodenly played by ryan phillipe ) , and matched brunette pair of protagonists , julie james and ray bronson ( woodenly played by party of five ' s jennifer love hewitt and freddie prinze jr . , respectively ) cheer her on . after getting drunk at a party , going to a beach to wittily discuss urban legend and indulge in some foreshadowing , and having some meaningful sex ( if you believe what the characters say ) , the four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night . his face is mangled so they can ' t tell who it is , and they come to the decision to dump him in the ocean so as to not ruin any of their future chances for success in the world . cut to one year later . the lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad . main brunette female , the bright one of the bunch , has been plagued with guilt and almost failed out of college . blond female has forfeited her dreams of starring on guiding light , and now works at the family store in town . brunette male is a fisherman , living off the land . blond male has become a complete jerk and quarterback on some college football team . then , predictably , their past comes back to haunt them . it all begins with an irrational murder , followed by some taunting of protagonists by the mysterious killer , bad acting by a good actress ( anne heche ) , an improbable plot , bad acting by the main bad actors , some more killing , concluding in a climactic scene , mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie . all the while , the actors and actresses spout off bad lines , and main brunette male does his best keanu reeves imitation . not that the movie was without pleasure . count the illogical plot twists and bad lines for some fun . mostly , though , note the costumes of main females and how trendily unattractive they make the otherwise eye - catching pair look .", "jamaica is a hot vacation spot . the exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth ( approximately 30 jamaican dollars to one american ) , the sea is a brilliant blue , the air is warm but lacks humidity . and as tourism is unfortunately jamaica ' s biggest trade , foreigners enter and leave with a sense of relaxation . life and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country . while normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music , this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface . the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid . it guides the audience along a tourist ' s journey and the story of the native inhabitants . instead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen , it quips , \" you don ' t see what happens after you flush the toilet . \" this engages a viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there . this strong , sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film . stephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals . this isn ' t just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life . people are interviewed from all sectors of occupation , from field to factory , as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country . the variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer , whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not . of course , as can be expected , the united states is slammed , owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank . officials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica ' s economy will help the country back on its feet , but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word . the next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed , usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the u . s . is forcing on the citizens . admittedly , some of the back and forth between the business - minded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive , but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument . but jamaica isn ' t against the united states , and this documentary does not accuse the u . s . of being the sole perpetrator of its grief . if anything , it begs for a better understanding of the nature of jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations .", "the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily . three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making . they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house . from there , things become a little more complicated . i can say , with absolute assurance , that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me . although i know it was all a staged \" mockumentary \" , there ' s no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you . i didn ' t feel much upon initially watching it . i just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts . i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend . i ' ve gotten chills every time i ' ve brought it up since then . this is not a movie that hits you right away . instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine , waits until you think everything is okay , then it slowly starts to creep it ' s way up into your mind . this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch . the film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film , so don ' t expect any steadi - cam shots or fancy camera work . this is as real as it gets folks . i don ' t recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though , because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera . the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real , you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not . this is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing , especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera . the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape - to - film transfer done for the big screen . word has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras ( hours of deleted scenes , alternate endings , commentary , the sci - fi channel special , and others ) is being planned for release . i urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvd ' s . i know i ' ll be first in line to buy one .

( he was also awarded an oscar , so i guess that would be a grand exception ) . robert rodriguez is also a great director ; not a brilliant one , but a cool one . i ' ve never seen an alexandre rockwell or allison anders film , so i can ' t comment on them . but in this crap ensemble director ' s film , all four give pitiful efforts . pitiful for any director , too . now in all fairness , ensemble director pieces never really work out . i ' ve never seen all of \" new york stories , \" but have heard the first two films , by scorsese and francis ford coppola are crap ( i saw woody ' s one , which was hilarious but not totally up to par ) . but i will rate each film individually and then report back to you on the overal average score of the film . exposition : a simple one - a bellhop , ted ( the totally overdone tim roth , who ' s a god and all , but not in this one , though he has a couple good moments ) is working on new year ' s eve for his first shift ( ! ! ! ) in an old fancy hotel . he ' s the only one there ( again : ! ! ! ) and he only has a couple rooms ( yet again : ! ! ! ) . the old bellhop ( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence - who hated pulp fiction actually ) hands over his cap to ted and he goes to his job happily . as the night goes on , he becomes increasingly annoyed and hostile . yea . ( the short films are presented in order , btw ) : the missing ingredient writer / director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt this one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue . the situation is so terrible that it ' s physically painful to watch . the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! ) stuck inside some object in their hotel room . the witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it . yeah , that ' s what i said . stupid plot , inane characters who aren ' t interesting at all , etc , etc , etc . the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully . not even actually funny for a second . my rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! ! the wrong man writer / director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on . ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at \" coming back \" ) who are playing sex games . ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon . but at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much . and david proval has never overacted as much . and it ' s \" pulp fiction \" producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window . a masterpiece compared to the first one , but still . . . the misbehavers writer / director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek would a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek ' s navel ? nope . luckily she ' s on the tv dancing so we get to see her . surprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential . it was fast - paced , funny , and well , funny . but when i watched it , it seemed anti - climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once . antonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny . but , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it ' s more painful than funny . but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time . oh ! the plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year ' s party . antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong . . . it was okay . the man from hollywood writer / director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again ) ironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film . he plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box - office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti - climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row . they ' re drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn ' t light . they also pay him a lot of cash . this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it ' s campy . tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves ' cause they ' ve had hits , major or minor . it took quentin to realize that . but the thing is , it doesn ' t seem like he realizes that . if he did , i ' d give this a good 3 stars . but this sucked . it was anti - climactic and the dialogue wasn ' t very good . he starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes . that makes no sense . it ' s cool for a while , then he makes it uneven . it ' s long and it ' s just not very good . hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one . conclusion : what ' s the moral here ? if you ' ve made celebrated films , don ' t do an ensemble piece . they should have re - watched \" new york stories \" and then stopped in their tracks . none of these have any point to them and they ' re embarrassing to not only the writer / directors , but to the actors ' cause they ' re working with crap . but i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin ' s next directing job ( even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool \" from dusk till dawn , \" which i found exhilerating ) . i love quentin and i suppose it ' s good he made \" the man from hollywood \" because it makes him seem more realistic and not some \" god of cinema . \" i seem to respect directors if they aren ' t \" gods \" and are actually human beings who make mistakes . \" the man from hollywood \" is his big mistake and let ' s hope he doesn ' t return her continuously .", "the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes . alas , it refers to our heroes ! as it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further . after all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one . but the human race doesn ' t have much to worry about . after all , there ' s a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis ) out there stopping the computer virus . she ' s the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) , steve baker ( william baldwin ) , woods ( marshall bell ) , squeaky ( julio oscar mechoso ) , and richie ( sherman augustus ) . they ' re all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous , abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters . lucky for us , we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board . the evil captain everton thinks he ' s going to take the ship in and get a reward ; he convinces his crew that there ' s going to be big money , so they try to salvage the ship . soon , however , when it ' s apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power , they realize that something bad must have happened . finally , they meet nadia ( joanna pacula ) who explains their situation : a computer virus has taken over the ship ! it ' s creating bio - mechanical life - forms to eliminate the human race ! virus is a truly dumb action thriller , one of negligible intelligence and innovation . when considering the entire film , you will realize that it lacks a single original scene . it ' s a direct rip - off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens , the abyss , and the terminator films are the most plagiarized ) ; more importantly , it ' s basically the same movie as last year ' s deep rising . i liked deep rising simply because it ' s funny -- it knows it ' s silly and derivative . virus takes itself seriously . and , in the most serious manner possible , it steals from every good and bad film of the genre , showing you countless familiar scenes , and sporting a cookie - cutter plot that any film of the sci - fi / horror genre could fit with a little trimming . but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out . okay , let me get this straight -- the alien race ( which is never really explained ) is basically sentient electricity . they need to make themselves physical , so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water , but who cares about that ) . on the ship , they make a bunch of clunky , immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people . after that , they start using the dead people to create half - human , half - machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around . the leader , of course , is a big creature . every film like this has a big creature at the end , but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around . virus is indeed a cliched film , but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn ' t very threatening . it ' s established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it , but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there . on one level , virus is almost passable fun . it ' s really gory , and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal ( the director , john bruno , worked on a lot of cameron ' s films ) . there ' s also a nice array of actors , even though none of them do any acting ( except for donald sutherland , who does a lot of very bad acting ) . the bottom line , however , is this : virus is a bad movie . it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing . in that order , i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films , simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes .", "you ' d think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games . it hasn ' t worked so far . \" street fighter ? \" \" super mario brothers ? \" \" wing commander ? \" \" mortal kombat ? \" not a watchable film in the bunch . still i held out some hope for \" tomb raider . \" after all , the game ' s premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies , so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept . however , despite the potential of the project , \" tomb raider \" proves to be yet another bomb . the plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from a dozen bad movies . there ' s a once - ever - 5000 - years alignment of planets coming up , and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world . of course , the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world . our heroine , lady lara croft ( angelina jolie ) , finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father ( jon voight ) dug up . she figures that if she gets the triangle , she can bring her dad back from the dead . of course , no one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway . in both video games and action movies , the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences . however , the action in \" tomb raider \" shows little style or originality . there ' s lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin ' , but none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap direct - to - cable flick . the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer , \" the mummy returns , \" was much better ; it had its flaws , but its action was creative and large - scale . since winning her academy award for \" girl , interrupted , \" jolie hasn ' t taken any projects that would display her acting talents . \" tomb raider \" seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts ; so much attention is drawn to them that it ' s a shame there ' s no oscar for best performance by a wonderbra . while we don ' t see much of her acting ability ( with the exception of a wonderful upper - crust british accent ) , we do get a hint of jolie ' s less savory side . considering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie and her supposed obsession with death , having lara be obsessed with resurrecting her dead father ( and uninterested in any of the living males around her ) seems a poor choice . having jolie ' s real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier . i haven ' t decided what to make of director simon west yet . his first feature was the star - studded disaster \" con air , \" but my opinion of him improved with \" the general ' s daughter , \" which was thick with sultry atmosphere . now this train wreck . i hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of the cult tv series \" the prisoner . \" hollywood has already screwed up \" the avengers , \" and \" the prisoner \" represents a chance for redemption . ( by the way , speaking of british tv , \" red dwarf \" fans should look for chris \" rimmer \" barrie in his first major film role ) .", "\" it ' s not good to know too much about someone , charlie , \" charles warns his niece , charlie ( margaret welsh ) , with a devilish grin . charlie is infatuated with her namesake uncle , her \" soul mate \" as she calls him since her mother gave her his name . there ' s a lot to know about charles , not the least of which is that he strangled 3 widows back east . mark harmon , who looks like anything but a killer but specializes in playing them , plays charles , the merry widow murderer in the 1991 hallmark hall of fame remake of the 1943 hitchcock film , shadow of a doubt . and to avoid any questions about his guilt , we see charles in action in the opening scene with his last victim . the story takes place in the early 1950s in the small town of petaluma , california , where charles heads to avoid the police . john gay ' s script uses most of the original screenplay by sally benson , alma reville , and thornton wilder . karen arthur ' s direction is certainly no match for the great master , but on an absolute scale , the movie maintains a high level of suspense . when supercilious and deceitful charles comes to pay a visit of indeterminate length with his sister and her family in petaluma , they don ' t know about his nefarious activities . he showers them with elaborate gifts to buy the love they had already given him anyway . two mysterious and exceedingly clean - cut writers for a magazine show up to take pictures of the family for a spread on the \" average american family , \" but their interest is focused on uncle charles , especially on taking his picture and learning about his background . charlie , who first welcomed her uncle ' s visit , begins to feel more and more uncomfortable with him and suspicious of the disingenuous magazine reporters . the picture advances with a delicate power using small details such as the newspaper article that the uncle tries secretly to remove and that charlie discovers . the beauty of the story is the pas de deux between uncle and niece as they try to out psych each other . she wants him to leave , and he doesn ' t want to go , what with a local , rich widow as a prospective victim . will charles kill charlie first , or will she get him out of town . harmon is wonderfully creepy and smug , and welsh is tough but trapped . with a deft touch the director sets up each scene , several with thunderstorms , and tom neuwirth ' s sepia - toned cinematography makes the movie feel as if it were filmed in the 50s . my only quibble is the director ' s awkward staging of the final scene on the train . is hitchcock ' s version better ? of course . is this one worth watching as well ? actually , yes . shadow of a doubt runs 1 : 40 . it is not rated but would be pg for adult themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up .", "many people dislike french films for their lack of closure . while possibly shallow , i ' ve often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view . there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion - denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) . stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker . he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing . even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches . in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man . camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes . maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife . like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges . when stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals . however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him . stephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present . as the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another . these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently . stephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship . however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation . the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher . however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing . consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays . in contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier . however , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world ' s finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing . during the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions . stephane attempts to remain unchanged . however , we do see subtle hints of his transformation . one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash . the development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible . american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development . in its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane . the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille ' s and stepahne ' s characters . i am not sure why berardinelli says , \" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil ' s credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . \" this movie is not about judging stephane ' s actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are . i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling . this portion of the film is where the \" sense of closure \" could have been successfully accomplished . unfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera - type surge of emotions from all of the characters . while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film . the synergism of the tension of ravel ' s music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen . the directing in this movie is wonderful . the actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth . emmanuelle beart ' s personality is beautiful . and needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful . besides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral . i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of . the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ? i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing . in summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship . in the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people . in itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie . where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people . i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture . however , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film . i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it .", "ugh . that about sums this movie up . just , ugh . the original godzilla movies are somewhat of a cult classic , and when reviewing the previous films , each film had a certain degree of intelligence . and that was the reason they found such an enviable cult following ; in spite of bad special effects , horrible dubbing , and a man in a lizard suit , they maintained a certain degree of . . . how to put this ? . . . dignity ? not quite the word i ' m looking for . you understand , right ? and in 50 years , godzilla has maintained that degree of ' whatever ' . leave it to america to screw the whole thing up . > from the ' geniuses ' that brought us \" independece day \" , arguably the worst sci - fi movie of all time , to ruin whatever reputation godzilla had . while they do bring us eye - popping special effects that will amaze you , they lost what was at the center of all the original godzilla movies -- a storyline . summing up the movie is simple . heck , i can do it in one sentence : giant lizard attacks a giant city and a bunch of nobodies stop it . simple as that . matthew broderick stumbles over his lines , and it ' s hard to picture hank azaria in any role besides his classic dog - walking character on the television show \" mad about you \" . the dialogue seems to be improvized , almost as if there was no rehearsel done at all . i can see the scene on the set right now . \" all right ! we spent all of this money making big special effects , and we ' ve gotta get this movie out by summer or it ' s going to bomb in our faces . so , you actors just say what ever comes to the top of your head , all right ? make up something , m ' kay ? good . roll film ! ! \" the special effects are enough to keep you interested through one viewing , and some of the cinemtography is well - done ( the scene with the black umbrellas comes to mind ) . still , an hour into it , you will become antsy , wondering how long they can drag it out . and drag it out they do ! ! i have to laugh . the slogan for the film is , \" size does matter \" . i think they cut this too short . it should read , \" size does matter . acting does not . \"", "an energetic , visually stunning , but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d ' arc . in history jeanne d ' arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy , which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors , who can basically alter the story as they wish . she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint . a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness . director / writer luc besson ( ' nikita ' , ' leon ' ) portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft . besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend . he tries not to show her as a saint or a villain . he shows her as a human being . in a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky , and the air smelled of rotten flesh , it is hard to keep your sanity . the only support and hope is in god . at the age of 13 , jeanne ( milla jovovich ) watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers . this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne ' s mind . god is no longer her support . he has become her obsession . she starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny . with the help of the wise yolande d ' aragon ( faye dunaway ) and charles vii ( john malcovich ) , whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake , jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls . after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield , where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences , only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo . the movie is filled with dreamy , symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship , that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere . the film is lost in time and space , hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne ' s thoughts , imagination and conscience . besson ' s visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age , feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle . but the film is far from being flawless . the script needs a lot of polishing . except for jeanne , there are no real characters . and although a grand star cast is assembled , their characters are nothing more than props , not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing . as for the maiden of lorraine herself , she is portrayed as a simple girl , too small for her divine task . in the latter part of the film , we see her as hysterical , confused and on the brink of madness , with her past purity and innocence for ever lost . jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect . but though her screen time is incredible excessive , both malcovich ( ' being john malcovich ' ) and dunaway ( ' titus ' ) surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance . and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part . besides casting jovovich , besson ' s only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting . there are some viscously evil englishmen that murder , pillage and betray with a smile on their faces . and some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen , represented by the \" three musketeers \" of this story -- the brave gilles de rais ( vincent cassel ) , the wise aulon ( desmond harrington ) and the strong la hire ( richard ridings ) . though all those actor perform well , their characters are nothing more than symbols -- banners that proclaim the glory of france . and thus , there is no sense of realism in this film . ' the messenger ' has muscles instead of brains . there is some relief in the end , where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking . dustin hoffman ' s appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise . jeanne ' s character is unlocked , but whether god was in the picture or not , is never quite explained . was she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge ? or was she truly a messenger of god ? the film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious . bess o messenger ' is nothing more than a fairly good film . it is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater . maybe the sound , the dreamy sequences , but certainly not the dialogue . it is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv - generation , that although presents some interesting material , works better when it ' s on the battlefield .", "seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) . one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise . with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with ` dark city ' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully - constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie . there ' s an old role - playing computer game called ` d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can ' t remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don ' t have control over the protagonist . we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it ' s more than just the city , it ' s the whole reality ) that isn ' t just that neo - gothic look ( a la ` batman , ' ` blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it ' s almost a different genre completely . later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what ' s going on other than the fact something is not right . the fact there ' s a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . the man doesn ' t know who he is nor where he ' s going and it ' s interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it ' s impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we ' ve observed them for a while . but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft - spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . two other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john ' s doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film - noir movies . it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in ` dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don ' t seem to be able to afford any gratuities . however , that might also be what ' s keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it ' s all a hoax . everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . but , as the film ' s tagline says , ` last night , one of us went off . ' for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as ` tuning ' ) . the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . this premise certainly is interesting and director and co - screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . he does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to ` the strangers ' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . the aliens mix and match the memories of the city ' s population to see who will change and who will not . in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought - provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don ' t help either ) . for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film ' s plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film ' s climax and ending . and that ' s what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . ironically , this is what made his first film ` the crow ' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . with ` dark city ' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . there ' s a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . ` dark city ' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world .", "well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task . he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films . in a domain that he owns , it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script from a bad one . eraser , back in 1996 , was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense . batman and robin , in 1997 , was the black sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting , idiotic action scenes , and painfully flashy costumes . now in 1999 , \" end of days \" ( not \" the end of days \" ) is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold . is this the end of a powerful action star ' s long - lived career ? will arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past ( \" terminator \" , \" terminator 2 : judgement day \" , \" predator \" ) ? or an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in the past ( \" commando \" , \" red sonja \" , \" true lies \" ) ? it doesn ' t look that way . \" end of days \" begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably , due to the formation of the stars on that night , will be the carrier of satan ' s baby the hour before new year ' s of 2000 . fortunately for the movie ' s sake , the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers , subway trains in dark tunnels , and a myriad of inept nypd officers . it ' s an action film ' s dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up . imagine if the girl had lived in anytown , usa , where the only thing to destroy is a dairy queen and a post office . arnold schwarzenegger ( jericho cane ) , in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church , who is trying to hide the girl ( or in some cases trying to kill her ) , and satan ( gabriel byrne ) who is trying to make her pregnant . if the devil is successful , the world will no longer exist as we know it . jericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1 ) he once had faith but no longer does and 2 ) his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it . jericho cane is your cliched , by - the - numbers hero right up to his name . arnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can . he shouts at everyone , from cops to priests , to the devil . in one truly hilarious scene , which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point , jericho screams to the devil ; \" you are a @#$^% ! & choir boy ! you are a choir boy ! \" those two lines marked the high points of this film . a movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor . \" end of days \" fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne . byrne , playing a man who has been made the manifestation of the devil , seems to be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie . he wonderfully plays a manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time . the annoying thing about his character , however , is that he has the power to kill any human with a simple punch in the face , yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho . i can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody . the other actors in the film give very weak and unconvincing performances . kevin pollak , who plays the partner and close friend of jericho , is the supposedly funny character in the film ( every action movie has one ) . the one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line . robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan ' s baby with extreme annoyance . she gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the film , except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter , or any of the viewers in the audience . in one unnecessary scene , tunney walks out of her room and takes her top off . is this her job in the film ? the actors are not to blame entirely because the script is terrible . you can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen minutes before it does . this little prediction game is a very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of a movie . in a last attempt to make this movie good , special effects are used to try to entertain the audience . but without a memorable action scene in the whole film , the director has not done his job successfully . this film would have gotten a c + if arnold stood in front of a camera and shouted \" you are a ! $@^@ * ^ choir boy ! ! \" for two hours .", "in _daylight_ , sylvester stallone breaks no new ground , cinematically speaking , but he covers familiar territory quite well . yesterday , as i was going about my business in the university bookstore , i noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it . i had never heard of the movie , so i stopped by to check it out . it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering . so , i shrugged , thought , \" hey , they probably won ' t give me the card anyway , and i could always use a free movie , \" so i signed up . all in all , i don ' t think i got that bad of a deal , either . rob cohen , who has previously brought us such films as _dragon : the bruce lee story_ and , more recently , _dragonheart_ ( gee , i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ? you think ? ) , now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture , with fx by industrial light and magic , about the after - effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey . sylvester stallone plays kit latura , who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _cliffhanger_ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed . when the crisis hits , he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out . there are other similarities to _cliffhanger_ , too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _cliffhanger_ had a villain , where _daylight_ ' s bad guy is mother nature . in fact , had the two movies been made in hong kong , this might have been titled _cliffhanger ii_ -- it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film \" sequels \" do to their predecessors . the first half - hour of _daylight_ is setup . subplots are woven , and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled . we meet all the important people . . . toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young , frustrated , jilted , rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others . we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons . and then , thirty minutes into the film , _boom_ . and it ' s a big one . > from there on in , it ' s sly stallone to the rescue . and rescue he does , enduring batterings , beatings , falls , repeated immersion in 34 - degree water , explosions , mud , rats , and constant setbacks , before going on to save the day , sly - style . again . . . there ' s nothing new here . and yet there doesn ' t need to be . the fun of _daylight_ is not in the story but in the execution . the special - effects are first - rate , thanks to industrial light and magic , and the ensemble cast works well together . once the film hits its stride , it carries the viewer right along to the finish , with very few jars along the way . this review is copyright 1996 by christopher e . meadows . permission granted for distribution through rec . arts . movies . reviews and all associated archival . permission granted for free redistribution via cyberspace as long as this message remains attached . all other rights reserved to the author .", "has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears ?

( i stopped looking at my wife during the screening , since every time i did , she ' d start sticking her finger in her throat . and she ' s right , it is that bad . ) directed without any imagination by steve boyum , whose long background in film is mainly in stunts and in second unit direction , the film limps along at best . boyum attempts to keep the pace moving by staging stunts , stunts and more stunts . amazingly for someone with his background , he seems incapable of finding any fresh ones , and we have a car go off the road five different times -- maybe more . but who ' s counting ? and then there is the script by james herzfeld , whose only other film , tapeheads from a decade ago , was so awful that it is considered a cult classic . meet the deedles , however , is painfully bad rather than laughably bad . it will probably be in and out of the theaters like a tornado and is in no danger of becoming a classic anything . herzfeld treats us to gratingly abysmal dialog that includes \" your geyser ' s a geezer , \" and \" i ' d like to put a deedle in her haystack . \" as the movie opens , the twins , who at one point describe themselves modestly as \" a walking kodak moment , \" are celebrating their 18th birthday . as they ride a parasail high above the waters of waikiki , a truant officer pursues them on his jet ski . as heirs to the fabulous fortune of the deedle empire , the boys are sent by their father to camp broken spirit at yellowstone to transform the two laid - back beach bums into men . as they arrive in their wetsuits in yellowstone , they ' ve got their surfboards , skateboards , and a hawaiian drink machine the size of an armoire . their camp has gone out of business , but they are mistaken for new park rangers . the rest of the movie has them fighting the park ' s overpopulation of prairie dogs as well as a deranged ex - ranger , played by dennis hopper , who is out to stop old faithful before its billionth birthday celebration , scheduled for later in the week . hopper , who has made some wonderful movies , carried away being a recent favorite , does have a propensity for choosing some truly odoriferous material . this isn ' t his worst acting , but meet the deedles is arguably the worst movie he ' s ever been in . steve van wormer and paul walker , as stew and phil , give lifeless performances . the only actor in the movie with any demonstrable talent is a cute little prairie dog named petey . even the cinematography by david hennings is so prosaic that it manages to make yellowstone look dull . to add insult to injury , hennings is fond of inappropriate close - ups , which only serve to remind us of the inanity of the dialog . put a ten - foot pair of lips on the screen , and you naturally pay extra attention to what is said . although boyum says in the notes that he is proud that his film is appropriate for families , one wonders how many skateboarders will attempt the movie ' s stunt of lying on your back on a skateboard while negotiating a busy and twisting mountain road . they make it look like so much fun that i ' m sure many will try some variation of the stunt . \" how could this possibly be worst , \" asks phil . just when you suspect it can ' t , the movie takes a turn further downhill . its low point may have you looking for an airline barf bag . after phil ' s girlfriend digs up a big mount of moist soil , they suck in a long worm . like the two dog lovers eating spaghetti in lady and the tramp , their lips finally meet in a kiss . as they pull back , their faces are full of the dirt that encased the worm they have just ingested . meet the deedles runs about an hour and a half . it is rated pg for a little bathroom humor and would be acceptable for kids around 6 and up . my son jeffrey and his friend nickolas , both almost 9 , gave the show * * * . they both thought the scenes with petey were among their favorites . nickolas also mentioned the scene in which the circus bear drives a jeep , and jeffrey especially liked the one in which the circus elephant was referred to as dumbo .", "dead - bang , an action thriller starring don johnson , lives up to its dumb title , or at least to half of it . although dead - bang is definitely dead , it is anything but a bang ; in fact , they should have called this one \" dead bore . \" in the film , johnson plays . . . you guessed it . . . a cop . the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character , jerry beck , is a gritty los angeles homicide detective , a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on \" miami vice . \" a la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life . beck ' s wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children . she will not even allow him to wish them \" merry christmas \" by telephone . but beck ' s family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead - bang . beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop . his investigation starts in l . a . and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp . virtually every aspect of dead - bang is inept and ineffective . the plot is incoherent and full of holes . the movie depicts beck ' s investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions . the action sequences in dead - bang are strictly third - rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense . i certainly expected more from long - time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate -- as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii . in all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead - bang ' s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction . dead - bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting . according to the movie ' s production notes , dead - bang is based on the real - life experiences of still - active detective jerry beck . you would never guess this from watching dead - bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable . most of the characters in dead - bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above . william forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by - the - book fbi agent who ' s offended by beck ' s foul language and unorthodox methods . forsythe ' s lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable . dead - bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid ( \" wkrp in cincinnati \" and \" frank ' s place \" ) , but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role ; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains . the sole function of penelope ann miller ' s character is to give dead - bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less . i guess the film ' s title refers to this love scene since it ' s definitely a dead bang . the only real virtue of dead - bang , believe it or not , is don johnson , who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie ' s pitiful script . johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth , and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life . and i must admit that dead - bang does have one or two amusing moments . the funniest scene has johnson throwing - up all over a criminal as he interrogates him . but when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie ' s in trouble . the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can ' t keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen . but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make .", "director doug ellin ' s kissing a fool , released earlier this year , is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story . like a sitcom with jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laugh track on it , the movie meanders along insulting the viewers ' intelligence in almost every frame . the script by james frey and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines you ' ve heard before .

the actual act . max , being promiscuous by nature , worries that his future bride may have the same need to sleep around as he does . the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work . neither the script nor the actors make this test believable . \" the 64 , 000 question is : how do you know you ' re with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life ? \" jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding some seriousness to the film . finally , there is the film ' s attempt at physical comedy . jay '

as she throws her hair on his bare chest , she demands he pull it . this is supposed to be funny ? most films have some saving grace . some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture wasn ' t . kissing a fool , on the other hand , has nothing to recommend it . kissing a fool runs 1 : 45 . it is rated r for profanity and sexuality and would be acceptable for most teenagers .", "this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground , despite some good performances from a basically competent cast . eddie ( sean penn ) and maureen ( robin wright penn ) are a not - so - happily married couple down on their luck . living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city , they spend what little income they have at the local bar , owned by shorty ( stanton ) , eddie ' s best friend , and his wife georgie ( mazar ) . maureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie ' s frequent disappearances . on his return , he promises her the world and professes his undying love . their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows , as eddie disappears again . like a junky craving the next high , maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high . their relationship is further complicated by maureen ' s pregnancy . she wants the baby and the father , but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter . during one of eddie ' s absences , maureen is attacked by kiefer , her neighbor , who gets her drunk ( with her cooperation ) and then insists on intimacy . she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do -- not to her , but to kiefer . she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage . he lashes out as she expects , and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months -- but in reality is 10 years . during this decade , maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual , joey ( travolta , in a small role ) . her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her . joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband ( and father of two children ) and stability ( joey makes a good living , drives a cadillac , and they live in a large house in the suburbs ) and the love of her previous life . she chooses her past , and sacrifices not only her new life but her old ( by giving up her and eddie ' s daughter to joey ) . but the eddie that she knew is gone , replaced by a mere shell of the man he was . maureen is herself a mere shell , more an automaton than a woman -- as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him .

screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell ' s infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo - smashing excesses of the disco era ' s heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . so when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down - and - dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first - timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . my , how easily does the worm turn . hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th - hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio - imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . at the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers ' s last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . and with good reason -- somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . boring . although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_ ' s lifelessness . _54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight - knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl / aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh - from - jersey shane o ' shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . these characters are about as generic as those descriptions . in focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . with the exception of the flamboyant , always - woozy rubell ( myers , in a well - modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers ' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club ' s famously hard - ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow ' s feisty dottie , a disco - and drug - crazed granny , but she ' s a peripheral character at best ) . as such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . what is a disco film -- especially one about the pinnacle of the movement -- without the dancing ? even whit stillman ' s _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn ' t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip - to - only - themselves club - hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . dancing isn ' t the only thing glazed over in _54_ -- so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher ' s fault . from what i ' ve heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54 ' s legend . but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane ' s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . shane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do - gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . this tacked - on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . they fail on both counts . ultimately , _54_ ' s failure comes down to three letters : f - u - n . as in , there isn ' t any to be had for the audience . too much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . anyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn ' t get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film ' s conclusion ( one of the last - minute reshoots ) . strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there -- two of them , in fact -- but _54_ is not one of them . they ' re on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings - on within it show that there ' s still a great disco movie to be made . the problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course .", "screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker . screenplay by andrew kevin walker . inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving . directed by tim burton . starring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien . special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken . synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation . townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them . cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery . comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years . batman , of course , is perhaps his best - known film and led to a string of less successful sequels . he ' s done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children ' s movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) . sleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies . sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios ' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international ' s series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe . christopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders . the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s . one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein . i mention these allusions for a reason . seasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film . with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this . not only does it have a sense of history , but burton ' s skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror . the film ' s eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie . johnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving ' s original story and is now an investigator . depp is adequate in his role . no more ; no less . equally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film . she ' s a good witch too . how cute . one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters . the two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine . veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers . while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing . you have to pay attention . andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay . he ' s the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven . walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn ' t hurt his growing reputation . as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic . there ' s a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings . this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to . a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest ' s eyes with her hand . he was obviously upset by the movie ' s intense violence . if you ' re looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended .", "teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood . every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular , and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights , wallets in hand . the formula is very simple , you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal . you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds , and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes , the typical teenage attention span . the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to , and , most importantly , they don92t care to judge films = 92 quality , so any piece of trash will = due . that is just what never been kissed , the latest film from director raja gosnell , is ; trash . josie geller ( drew barrymore ) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times . she has her own personal assistant , unlimited supplies , and her own office . but she is very much dismayed with her position in life . there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field , where she can play a more active role in the chicago media . so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere , she jumps at it with elation . constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita ( molly shannon ) and her amicable superior , gus ( john c . reilly ) . the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment , as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter . however , since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict , this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes , and josie is headed for the field . obviously , the field assignment involves a high school . specifically , she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school , by enrolling in the senior class and \" becoming one of them . \" i don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring , so i won92t . the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school . interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again . fortunately for this lame production , other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting . they include the predictable love stories , between both a student ( jeremy jordan ) and a teacher ( michael vartan ) , to show that josie is really two people in one body . also , her younger brother and opposite , rob ( david arquette ) comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative . the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing . typical for teenage films , it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor . one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical . most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy . but those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie . following this trend of high school movie rules , comes the general acting . it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film . in this case , drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch . she is required to play her character on two levels , having some very black and white transitions . and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray , she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time . at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel , and is expected to him on an adult level , since he is one , her teacher . but she never seems to get out of the gray area , and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance . following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon ( saturday night live ) . she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to , and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic . it is these \" qualities \" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent . luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film . david arquette ( scream ) takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic , and not have his brilliant acting ruined . and as a central character he gets to take on his own mini - plot , which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed . in a dazzling cherry - on - the - sundae type piece of work , he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit , risky business . never been kissed is a mediocre film at best . the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood , that it is sickening to watch time and again , and this film is no exception . the acting is just as bad , but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light . unfortunately , the bottom line is that the movie will be a success , because teenagers will pay to see any trash .", "yet another brainless teen flick , this one is about , surprise , drugs and sex . stars katie holmes and sarah polly couldn ' t look more bored . their characters are cardboard cut - outs of every cliched teenager out there . one thing you need to know is i really hated this movie . everything about it annoyed the hell out of me . the acting , and script , the plot , and ending . the director ( of the fluke hit swingers ) could have very well directed a bunch of no - name actors and had a watchabe film . the \" big \" stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality . i felt like i was watching dawson ' s creek episode 200 . although the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast . the \" surprise \" ending was sooo predictable . since when is a male character ' s sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore ? ? go is dawson ' s creek + varsity blues - she ' s all that = go home and watch something else .", "the most amazing thing about paul cox ' s innocence is how unlike a movie it is . i mean that as the highest compliment . if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40 - year - old romance , i ' d want to run and hide . the sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters ' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence . along with a charming romantic story , the australian / belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable . the romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles \" bud \" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby . they decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair . complicating matters is andreas ' frail health , and claire ' s longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can ' t understand why he ' s suddenly become obsolete . in my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved . john , claire ' s husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong . claire initially insists she ' s a grown - up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her . andreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence . cox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train . it ' s a reminder of andreas and claire ' s past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed . a pall is cast on the whole affair . a master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments . in andreas ' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire ' s love . we also get glimpses into john and claire ' s relationship . during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could . all that ' s heard is the scraping of forks against plates . the characters are unlike anything i ' ve seen -- they ' re people . so many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky . or they ' re reduced to comedic buffoons . ordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren ' t sure what the next step is . they do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they ' ve known throughout their adult lives . bravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire ' s affair is automatically justified . norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire ' s love difficult to accept . we feel for him . he ' s a decent man . sure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now . with so much presented to the audience , it ' s only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does . however , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ? lan isn ' t likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon .", "\" book \" should have remained in shadows book of shadows : blair witch 2 a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman certain things in our lives are inevitable . death , sorrow , love , heartbreak , pain , joy . we expect these events . we know they ' re going to happen and some , we even look forward to . it ' s part of the human condition . we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society . as we near the fall election , several of them are hitting us in the face . politicians exaggerate their own importance . our side is always right ; theirs is always wrong . in the end , voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares . in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money , there will be a sequel . even if the original story doesn ' t merit one . even if the first film is complete in itself . even if success is a fluke . \" the blair witch project \" was made with a budget of $ 1 . 75 and exploded on the screen , raking in huge profits . the concept was brilliant . the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real . the film itself was even more convincing . the movie _must_ be authentic . why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen ? the first film caught lightning in a bottle . the sequel proves you can ' t pour that old lightning into a new bottle . you have to give this effort some credit . it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids . it would have been easy , but of course , it wouldn ' t have worked . instead \" book of shadows \" acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release . it ' s a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel . unfortunately it doesn ' t work either . five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film . weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives . even weirder stuff happens . some people die , there ' s blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense . while supposedly doing serious research , the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation . then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud , very obnoxious heavy metal music . it ' s a bad plan . the cast shows some early promise . a couple is doing research on a \" blair witch \" book . the tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficionado . a goth amazon princess adds a bit of comedic relief . the obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick , the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick : the cute wiccan chick . the first film ' s unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods . this time , these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors . there ' s not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason . although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea , it ' s ruined by poor execution . the follow - up to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie . they ' re trapped in an old big weird house . they stupidly separate into various rooms . there are strange noises , they see scary apparitions and people disappear . ever see this movie ? seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better . the film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore . for a storyline filled with surprises , it ' s oddly predicable . \" the blair witch project \" was a rare triumph of style over substance . \" the book of shadows \" is a triumph of tedium over promise .", "you ' ve got mail works alot better than it deserves to . in order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits . no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it ' s body ( it ' s basically a complete re - shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) . essentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking . it ' s overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative . but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is . but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan / hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle . it couldn ' t have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman . i haven ' t quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you ' ve got mail , but then again , is that really important ? if you like something so much , why even question it ? again , the storyline is as cliched as they come . tom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family - run children ' s book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner . fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business . little do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person ' s true identity . the rest of the story isn ' t important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen . sure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship . all of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax . but as foreseeable as the ending is , it ' s so damn cute and well - done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does . when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling .", "denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances . this perhaps may be washington ' s very best to date . he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent , this season , to become his character , copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly . his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting \" the hurricane \" a much better film than it actually is . when his rubin \" hurricane \" carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices . the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago . the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in america ' s history . he is that amazing . the problem with \" the hurricane \" is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles . mainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors . this is , without a doubt , washington ' s movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars . denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance . as rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system . > from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit . then after a successful marriage and boxing career , he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder . carter ' s second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous , powerful white men who refused to let him succeed . from these past experiences in jail , carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america . after several court appeals , an autobiography , and many public marches for his freedom , carter remained locked in prison . it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter ' s book in the 1980 ' s , that a serious battle for freedom took place . the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released . the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation . washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again , he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career . the devastation in washington ' s eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it . in the hole , carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot . his anger is heightened to a point of no control . we see multiple carters , a violent angry one , a silent passive one , and a mediator . we see an emotional boxing match inside carter ' s head . from this point in the hole to the end of the film , this fight continues . it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite . when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison , the angry carter at first erupts . white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life , this reminder leads to anger in his head . however , as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him . he realizes that society is changing . that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world . very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here . if only the other actors had this same determination . dan hedaya , ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around . it felt like his character was taken straight out of a \" scooby doo \" episode ; he would have gotten away with it if it wasn ' t for those annoying little kids . \" the kids \" in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable . the lawyers who help release carter also are underused , as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard ( the complete opposite of his character in \" shawshank redemption \" ) . there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears . hedaya was superb in \" clueless , \" same for david paymer in \" get shorty , \" harris yulin in \" ghostbusters \" and liev schreiber in \" the daytrippers . \" it is a mystery how this many actors signed on to such shallow roles . on the other hand , it is absolutely no mystery why denzel washington agreed to play rubin \" hurricane \" carter . this role is about as far off from shallow as you can get .", "plot : a peculiar french girl grows up lonely with her father and doesn ' t quite know what she wants out of life . one day , she falls upon something , and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others . she starts with the people around her , but when she suddenly falls for her own guy , she can ' t act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature . critique : a clever , quirky , original french flick set in a picturesque paris , featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination , much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone . this is a \" feel - good \" kind of movie , a fairy tale for grown - ups who are bummed out about life . it doesn ' t pretend to be deep , it doesn ' t weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters , it ' s basically just a \" cute movie \" in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward , with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions ( and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year ( a sham on so many different levels ) , you might as well slap this film up for consideration also , since it ' s quite a bit better and much more original than the former ) . one thing that this film isn ' t though , at least according to me , is the best film of the year ( it was bestowed the honor of \" best \" in at least 3 different film festivals so far this year ) . it actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long ( it ' s a little over two hours but it felt even longer ) , with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters , all of whom weren ' t as interesting as the lead , and a lot of indecisiveness from ms . amelie herself , which got frustrating . thankfully , this film doesn ' t bog itself down with too much of that stuff , and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes , to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kind - hearted french girl . on the whole , it ' s a lot of fun and it carries a beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man . the lead , audrey tautou , is perfect for the role , and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film . unfortunately , the rest of the cast isn ' t as well - developed , and even though most of them are pretty appealing , a couple could ' ve been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plot - wise , by the film ' s end ( what happened to the guy in the caf ? who was spying on his ex - girlfriend the whole movie ? ) . now i haven ' t seen too many recent french films , i will admit , but if this is the kind of \" scene \" that they ' re developing over in \" le pays du vin \" , i wouldn ' t mind catching more of their flicks in the future ( crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year , which i really liked - ironically , that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz , who is the co - star in this film ) . granted , the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times ( i speak and understand french also , but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head ) , especially since the film ' s visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn ' t help but constantly gawk at them , but the general idea , the background music , the nifty french neighborhoods , the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the story - line from the start , were all very easy to appreciate , and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world . in fact , i ' d recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol ' time at the movie house , with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot of imagination , a little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts . and this guy directed alien : resurrection ? get outta here ! ! note : i especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the loves / hates of everyone with exact mentions in the film . it was very original , very well shot and very nostalgic , as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described . good stuff ! where ' s joblo coming from ? chocolat ( 6 / 10 ) - crimson rivers ( 8 / 10 ) - ghost world ( 9 /

, too . \" she ' s all that \" has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie i ' ve seen so far this year . and quite frankly , i doubt i ' ll see anything equally bad . ( at least , i * hope * i don ' t see anything equally bad ) . \" she ' s all that \" tells the story of the most popular guy in school ( played by freddie prinze jr . ) who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school ( rachel leigh cook ) into the most popular . that , right there , is problem # 1 . how many times have we seen this storyline ? as cook comments near the end of the film , \" it ' s kind of like \" pretty woman \" , except without the prostitution \" . of course , had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material , the well - worn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward . as it is , though , \" she ' s all that \" relies * completely * on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead . there ' s not one original or interesting character in the film , either , and if that wasn ' t bad enough , there ' s not one good performance featured . the star of the movie , rachel leigh cook , is simply horrible . i usually don ' t like to get so personal , but in this case , i think it needs to be said . cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was . i was never convinced that she was a \" nerd \" , and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary . the movie seems to be saying it ' s better to be popular than to be who you are . as for freddie prinze jr . , an actor i ordinarily enjoy , he too is quite bad here . he coasts through the film on so - called charm , and never establishes a real character . kieren culkin is here , too , as the brother of cook . and for some indiscernable reason , he ' s got hearing aids . no explanation is given and they ' re never brought up . were we supposed to feel * sorry * for him just because he wore hearing aids ? i don ' t think so . that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things i ' ve seen in a movie in a long time . \" she ' s all that \" sucks . that ' s what it boils down to . it ' s not entertaining , and it ' s not even a good time passer . the hour and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair - removal system informercial . and what ' s worse , it sends out a bad message to teens . it appears to be telling them , \" hey , it doesn ' t matter if you ' re happy the way you are . that ' s unimportant . if you want to * truly * be happy , dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubble - headed moron . \" ugh .", "originally titled ' don ' t lose your head ' , this parody of the scarlet pimpernel story was the first carry on to be produced by rank film productions . two english fops , the ' powdered , be - wigged , be - ribboned ' sir rodney ffing ( sidney james ) and his counterpart lord darcy pew ( jim dale ) decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine . due to a series of machinations and disguises , they are largely successful . ffing becomes known as ' the black fingernail ' because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up , one with a black fingernail . after the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit ( charles hawtrey ) , citizen robespierre ( peter gilmore ) orders the head of the secret police citizen ' the big cheese ' camembert ( kenneth williams ) and citizen bidet ( peter butterworth ) to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him .

a more complex story than most carry ons , this film enjoys good production values ( sets , costumes ) and an on - form cast . sid james is excellent as the english fop and black fingernail , kenneth williams excels as the evil camembert , and peter butterworth expertly plays the substantial part of camembert ' s thick - witted crony . other acting honours go to joan sims who is perfect as desiree and charles hawtrey who is excellent as the french aristo pommfrit . although it suffers from a disasterously over - long sword fight at the end of the film , it is largely successful due to the performances of the main stars , its slick and professional production , and its better - than - usual script . definitely one of the best of the series and a joy to watch .", "chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from -- you either find his helium voice , crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying . i think i fall into the former category ( i ' m one of the few who thought his turn in \" the fifth element \" as a prancing , prince - like deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating ) , but his new vehicle \" money talks \" just doesn ' t do him service . tucker is good in the movie -- and this is the kind of film that , if people see it , could make him a big star -- but he ' s also really the only thing good about the movie . in fact , if you see \" money talks , \" it should shock you beyond recognition that two of \" toy story \" ' s writers penned the sloppy script . tucker ' s role here is that of franklin hatchett , a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell ( charlie sheen ) . after being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports , franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard ( gerard ismael ) . but villard ' s thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader ( never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him ) , and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist , franklin is allowed to escape as well , but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that -- for some reason or another -- is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo . the local media mistakenly puts the prison break - out blame on franklin , which is where james comes back into the picture . he makes a deal to protect franklin if , in turn , franklin gives him an exclusive interview . this means james must present his new \" friend \" in the stickiest of situations -- a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace ( heather locklear ) , also attended by her uber - rich parents ( veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino ) . and of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off , all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james . \" this ain ' t no buddy movie , \" claim the print ads . yeah , right . actually , for the better part of , oh , 20 minutes , it appears \" money talks \" has the momentum to cover entertaining ground , and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker . this is tucker ' s first leading role , and if you imagine a slightly lankier , african - american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r - rated raunch rather than pg - 13 physical comedy , you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role . but you realize all too quickly that tucker ' s overstated liveliness is the only thing \" money talks \" has going for it . and a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make . it ' s all too easy to pick out everything wrong with \" money talks . \" the plot is recycled buddy - buddy comedy - thriller tripe that seemed overused even when \" nothing to lose \" employed it last month . everything is paint - by - numbers , especially the los angeles coliseum finale , which finds not one , not two , but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers . the villains , as many as there are , are dull . certain story elements are too coincidental . and too much of the film ' s dramatic agenda is played too straight . a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin ' s true identity ( \" you brought a killer into my parents ' house ! \" ) is extremely silly . you get the picture . obviously , i did not have a pleasant experience at \" money talks . \" but the people around me appeared to be having a rip - roaring good time ( one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health ) . but tucker , at least for me , is a pretty funny guy , and aces the movie ' s best scene , where franklin passes himself off as vic damone ' s son at james and grace ' s engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics . tucker ' s audience -- and he does have one -- will probably like \" money talks . \" those who he irritates , however , will have a more productive day staying home and scraping the gook out from under their toenails .", "renown surrealist director , the 77 - year - old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour / last year at marienbad / m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 ) . the film follows potter ' s gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip - synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts . he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as \" the umbrellas of cherbourg \" and \" the young girls of rochefort . \" the tale has resnais ' s unique touches as a director to go along with his homage . it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone ' s heart for every occasion . what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring . yet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs . also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors . it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there . it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness . they are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts . she is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi ) . she once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean - pierre bacri ) , who left her 8 - years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family . simon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real - estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays . simon ' s boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real - estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view . screenwriters and actors jean - pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts . jaoui ' s camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph . d . in history , using for her thesis the study of ' the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru . ' she works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self - control . on her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon , pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her , but not having the nerve to tell her this . to his dismay , he finds out she is dating his mean - spirited but handsome boss , whom she meets when looking at her sister ' s new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold , not because he ' s so sensitive . bacri as the classy nicolas , turns out to be now working as a chauffeur . he is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors , until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him . odile still pines for him , but he ' s married , telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly . love is ' the same old song ' that makes the world go ' round , even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are . everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile ' s place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be . there ' s not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best . this film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting . it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice . it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters ' behavior as being similar in business as in love .", "earlier this year , the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics . a real charmer of a movie , it ' s possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience . now , at the end of 1998 , comes waking ned devine , a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter . there ' s no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere -- they strike all the same chords -- but still , ned devine is a movie worth seeing . the plot is interesting and robust : the latest lottery winner is ned devine ( jimmy keogh ) , of tullymore , ireland . ned ' s prize is over six million pounds , but the shock of winning killed the poor old man , and the check remains unclaimed . enter jackie o ' shea ( ian bannen ) and michael o ' sullivan ( david kelly ) , the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village . the two men eventually find the ticket , and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he ' s actually ned , the entire town can reap the benefits ; their only adversary is an ancient old woman ( eileen dromey ) who sees more profit in reporting the fraud . ian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael . jackie , stocky and large , is the brains behind the operation ; michael , scrawny and short , is the method man . the two contrast each other delightfully , and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience . every viewer is sure to like both of them . there are other minor subplots included as well , such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer . this appears quite inconsequential until the end , and even with a startling revelation it ' s a tad bit unnecessary . overall , waking ned devine has a predictable outcome , and plot twists are never really taken seriously . the ending , a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate , somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout . the kirk jones script is indeed off - the - cuff . in a way , waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents : warm , friendly , outgoing , and jovial . it ' s the perfect kind of comedy , a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes . there ' s nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two , because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one . indeed , it ' s one of the year ' s best feel - good movies -- 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss .", "every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody ' s surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . mtv films ' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? the plot is deceptively simple . george washington carver high school is having student elections . tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over - achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . mr . \" m \" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular - but - slow jock to run . and paul ' s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . you can ' t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . _election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . the similarities are staggering : tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . he even gets a bee sting . the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . he gets several bee stings . and so on . what happened ? how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn ' t been fully formed yet ? even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul ' s anti - social sister , tammy . broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he ' s had since then . witherspoon is a revelation . it ' s early in the year , it ' s a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . and once campbell ' s character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you ' re won over . one thing that ' s been bothering me since i ' ve seen it . there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . it is bad enough that mr . m doesn ' t like tracy ' s determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student / teacher relationship ? even so , there ' s no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . there ' s a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex - driven , mark this as a disappointment .", "no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its = purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . event = horizon is not your run - of - the - mill sci - fi film , i ' m sure many who have = watched this will agree with me . it is not even original in that sense , = and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even = blade runner . the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and = methodical build - up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . the story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since = enormously progressed . the event horizon is actually a ship built for a = secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space = thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a = man ' s lifetime . the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation = but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . a = search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to = check for survivors of the event horizon . the designer of the ship , dr . = weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually = happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . event horizon is a sci - fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , = alien would ever be . while in alien , the crew has to cope with a = ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , = the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful = and horrifying . the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup = is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud = ` enough ! i can ' t stand this anymore !

cracking sidekick or two , pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror , a rousing anthem , a cutesy , montage - backed crowd pleaser ) , pose a few threats to our engaging lead , and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits . bob ' s your uncle ! better make that walt ' s your uncle . . . kids will no doubt go ga -

wise ) afterthought . however , after about an hour everything comes together and the formula , like it or not , clicks . highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow - covered pass ( which , due to the sophistication of today ' s computer - generated imagery , is hard to tell from the real thing ) , a memorable , show - stopping musical interlude ( \" i ' ll make a man out of you , \" penned by matthew wilder and david zippel ) , and last but not least , mulan herself . voiced by ming -

spirited mulan steals her father ' s armor and , incognito , signs up to face the mongolian menace . attracted to , but not distracted by , her commanding officer shang ( b . d . wong ) , mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts , wit , and physical ability . she ' s a woman of the ' 90s a couple of millennia ahead of her time .", "capsule : bleak and point - blank -- just the way it should be . makes its case with cold - blooded precision and intelligence . \" serial killer chic \" is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary , and one of the more stomach - turning ones . i ' ve never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers , and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry . i wasn ' t sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero / antihero . thankfully , that ' s not the way henry works . the director , john mcnaughton , took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work . it doesn ' t provide cheap - jack explanations for henry ' s behavior : it shows him up for what he is , an unrepentant and un - idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him . at the film ' s opening , henry ' s friend ottis toole has a sister , who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago . in a viciously riveting scene , he admits matter - of - factly to having murdered his own mother , and she covers his hand with hers . they are damned together from that moment on . henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun . the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it : there ' s a scene where the two go to buy a new tv . the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words , and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron . no preface -- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker . in a scene which many damned the movie for , unseen , they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household , playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment . the movie itself , however , does not glorify the killings , but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work , only irritation . henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting . michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame , just standing there , and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well . the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton , but he decided to give them something more memorable , and consequently the film nearly didn ' t see release . the film does not glorify or justify -- it just shows us , with unflinching coldness , what henry was . i ' m hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of \" victim \" or \" hero \" . then again , probably , so would henry .", "i admit it . i thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies . watching him in jingle all the way , i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids . it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg - 13 kindergarten cop , but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence , alcohol consumption , burglary , racism and child molestation . and you know they ' ll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa ' s elves . he later decks a reindeer . hey , man , why don ' t you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you ' re at it ? jingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass , it must be funny school of thought . arnold , sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team , and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene . what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can ' t find a rare toy on christmas eve , and will do anything to get one ? arnold is , of course , one of the parents , a crack salesman who is never there for his son . he races from the office to his son ' s karate game , only to find out he missed it . and his kid distrusts him because he ' s never around . ( gee , we haven ' t seen that in a movie before . ) arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son ' s affection is to get him a turboman doll , which his wife ( rita wilson , who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this ) told him to get weeks ago . so arnold sets out to find a turboman , which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out . let me back up for a minute here -- arnold ' s kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character , which is unhealthy beyond belief . watches the show , eats the cereal , sleeps on the freakin ' turboman sheets . i ' d try to discourage any further obsession myself , lest any kid seeing this movie think it ' s a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want . but nooooo , the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade , exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son , who don ' t recognize him until the last minute . this is a sad movie all the way through , but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store , racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who runs a bootleg toy factory . most painful to watch is a scene at a radio station , where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay ( an embarrassed martin mull ) who said he was giving away a turboman doll . capitalism has produced some pretty evil things ( chia pets ) , but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful . never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping ( \" your cookies are incredible \" ) , it ' s the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it ' s okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want . maybe that ' s what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house , but not at mine .", "it ' s been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it ' s been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly . i ' d saw that it ' s been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i ' m hardly comparing \" a simple plan \" to , say , \" rear window \" or \" strangers on a train . \" yet it ' s almost as good . it ' s simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they - might - be - caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral . elegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , \" a simple plan \" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim - witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) . without anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don ' t flaunt anything they don ' t want to flaunt , they ' ll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton . the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves . \" a simple plan , \" though borrows a little from each of these . a little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here . but , as austin powers would say , that ' s not necessarily its bag ( baby ) . what i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it ' s successfully able to have its cake and eat it too . it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag . so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity . in one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn ' t look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering - up ( read : homicide ) . instead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands - washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low - angle onto paxton ' s face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion . there ' s a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he ' s committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut - wrenching . in short , probably the best piece of direction raimi ' s ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch \" persona \" ' s \" sex scene \" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman ' s ever done ) . but the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof . yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story . when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights . there ' s at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don ' t come with masochistic delight but with cringe - inducing horror . during the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra \" they can ' t do this , can they ? \" streeming through my head . in fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen ' s [ superior , but forget about it ] \" fargo , \" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over - the - top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then again , after seeing the \" evil dead \" films , i ' d hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed \" raimi \" moments , a rifle - shot notwithstanding ) . instead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co - exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches . most particularly , billy bob thornton ' s character , jacob , is a brilliant creation . his dim - wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there ' s authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we ' re not totally laughing at him . the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full - condescension because thornton is so damn real . jacob ' s a multi - dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co - conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money . the final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great . i particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near - sweetness and further strength of his saddened character . thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he ' s ever given and further proof that he ' s the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don ' t believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in \" primary colors , \" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn ' t been in the same year ) because he ' s easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable . he brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it ' s difficult picturing anyone else in the role . the rest of the cast is great too , from paxton ' s declining working man to chelcie ross ' amiable town sheriff . even fonda shows off her talents nicely . and if i had any complaints about the film , it ' s that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved . and the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you ' re trying to set things up and / or express emotions - didn ' t raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) . and , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss . i won ' t reveal it , but it ' s way too cruel and too much of an outsider set - up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn ' t already too much of that anyway . for a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending . imagine a character - controlled ending ; otherwise , it ' s like if in \" crime and punishment \" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i ' m at all comparing \" a simple plan \" to dostoevsky . the ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day . but despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i ' ve frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile . at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece .", "synopsis : sonny koufax ( adam sandler ) is a rich , childish , angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa ( kristy swanson ) . in a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin ( jon stewart ) and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian ( cole and dylan sprouse ) while kevin is on an overseas trip . under sonny ' s supervision julian soon learns to lie to women , tell people how he \" wipes his ass , \" throw tantrums , and scream for his \" god damned \" treats . self centered , julian breaks a school classmate ' s arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong . meanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk , food , toys , and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform . not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny ' s incompetent supervision , and this leads to a custody battle . opinion : it ' s a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk , and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior . that ' s the essence of big daddy . but there ' s a bigger issue involved : marketing . movies that are rated pg and pg - 13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below . on tv , film clips advertise these movies as family - friendly hit comedies . then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard - - or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment . folks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff , but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation . to many american mothers there ' s probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a woman ' s \" ice cold tits . \"", "as bad as \" mimic \" was , it definitly scared me . \" mimic \" continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style , and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie . director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film \" cronos . \" that movie worked because it took an unconventional story , unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie . in \" mimic \" , del toro doesn ' t bother to give us anything original . the plot is a stupid combination of \" aliens \" meets \" species \" meets \" jurassic park . \" the characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies . there ' s nothing new in \" mimic \" . it ' s just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work . at the end of the movie , you ' re stuck wanting your money back . maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies : he forgot to turn the lights on . i don ' t understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the \" seven \" trend and be set in dark , dank areas . watching \" mimic \" i was tempted several times to yell at the screen \" turn the lights on ! the switch is to your right ! use common sense ! just do it ! you ' ll be able to see the monster in the corner ! \" there ' s a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off . it looked like the light operator was having a seizure , and sorvino didn ' t even notice - she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts . \" hmmm . . . . i think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight . \" \" mimic \" has a lot of incidental shock tactics ( boo ! just kidding ! ) and follows them up with the real scare , but nothing in this movie scares you . the audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments ; i think they were bored , too . i shouldn ' t blame del toro . he isn ' t the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie . hong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time , \" the killer \" and \" hard boiled \" then came to america to make the stupid \" broken arrow . \" french directors luc besson ( \" la femme nikita \" ) and george sluizer ( \" the vanishing \" ) followed woo ' s lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies . robert rodriguez , who directed the terrific low budget \" el mariachi \" came to hollywood and directed the horrible , high - budget \" desperado . \" i don ' t know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country can ' t make a good american movie . woo finally broke through and made \" face / off \" , but it still isn ' t up to par with his earlier films . i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office , chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director , \" welcome to america ! i bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long . do you speak english ? now , i know you think you ' ve made good movies in the past , but now you ' re in america , so things are a little different here . just remember what the american audience always wants , and you ' ll be fine . they want to see at least one big breasted woman , characters that they ' ve seen a thousand times before ( because change scares americans ) , and you always need a cheesy feel - good ending to wrap things up . if you don ' t make that kind of movie , you ' ll be shining my shoes in no time . \"", "this is a good year if you want plenty of sci - fi on your multiplex . > from the comedies mars attacks and men in black , to luc besson ' s powerful the fifth element , and to this , sci - fi / horror that is event horizon . ( more is on the way with contact and alien : ressurection being released later this year . ) the story is thus : in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive . a device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe , instantaneously . this is achieved by creating a gateway , infact , a black hole , between the craft and it ' s required destination . in this case , from near neptune to proxima prime . however , when the event horizon attempts this , it dissappears , without trace , leaving two searches for it fruitless . seven years later , it reappears , transmitting a distress signal and this is where the film starts . a search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate . the team is led by laurence fishburne , and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive . as the team search the event horizon , they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around . not a good sign . . . to make matters worse , as they search the ship , they find themselves being subjected to a series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse , some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago . it soon becomes apparent that , wherever the ship went , it bought something back with it . something very , very evil . . . the first thing you ' ll notice in this film is it ' s incredible visual effects . they really are eye popping , with some great models to boot . the acting is quite good , with some occasional witty moments . sam neill does a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more and more disturbed as the search continues , but a tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads the team , in a cool , calm , take no nonense manner . it is his acting skills that help hold this film together . the idea behind event horizon is certainly a good one . it starts off incredibly well , but the middle section becomes quite confused and sometimes muddled , leaving the viewer unsure on just what the reasons are behind some of the bloody and bizarre events that occur . however , the closing 20 minutes of the film more than make up for this , producing one the most nail biting ( or in my case , straw of my drink biting ! ) climaxes i ' ve recently witnessed . overall , event horizon is a smart film indeed . it ' s very enjoyable and has some amazing visuals . but be warned , the horror scenes , despite being very brief are very , very , gory . not for the squemish !", "it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it ' s stars , roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 . mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood , having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films . fright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles . this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was . william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us . ( at least in the movies anyway . ) it has been several years since charlie brewster ( ragsdale ) and b - movie actor turned late night horror film host , peter vincent ( mcdowall ) came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlie ' s next door neighbor . charlie and peter won that battle , but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family . apparently charlie ' s former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling . so she decides to exact a little bit of revenge . this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again . one of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie ' s stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood . fright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort . while they are stylish , the vamps in this film just don ' t have the personality of the undead in the first film . with the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes . one bright spot , speaking from a strictly sexist point of view , is traci lin , who plays charlie ' s very skeptical girlfriend . it ' s really a shame that her career hasn ' t been better since she made this film . ragsdale does a fair job in this film , but doesn ' t give nearly the performance that he did in the original . roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given , which unfortunately isn ' t much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie . i guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way . the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner , part 2 had more of the feel of a music video . never a good thing for a horror film . another minus for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare . for that matter , they were almost nonexistent . if i was going to watch a horror film , this would be far from my first choice . the first fright night , on the other hand , would be right up near the top of my list . if i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film i ' d probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes . either way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation .", "before even seeing a single frame of the film , it would be easy to snicker at deep impact , in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet . it is the latest entry in this decade ' s dubious revival of the ' 70s disaster film , and the first of two \" the sky is falling \" flicks to hit screens this year ( the other being this coming july ' s armageddon , in which a meteor is the threat ) . its tagline , \" oceans rise . cities fall . hope survives \" is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight ( \" they came in alone . . . the only way out . . . is together \" ) , but it ' s every bit as treacly . the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at . the cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions , such as the usual opening \" roll call , \" in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced . the most prominent of the \" personal \" stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) , who is distraught that her father ( maximilian schell ) left her mother ( vanessa redgrave ) for a younger woman ( rya kihlstedt ) . what is just as snicker - worthy is how this co - venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high - profile corporate collaboration , microsoft and nbc ' s cable news network msnbc , which employs jenny , who is the film ' s ostensible main character . in the vision of america presented here , msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home , when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country . the initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante ' s peak , but there ' s one thing about deep impact i underestimated : the skills of director mimi leder . she won an emmy for her helming work on nbc ' s smash er , which is essentially a weekly disaster movie , each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises . the challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold : ( 1 ) to make the audience care for these guest characters , regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are , and ( 2 ) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy - handed or overly melodramatic . having passed the \" er challenge \" in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker , leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin ' s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen . as the countdown to impact progresses , the ominous feeling of doom is palpable , leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension . there ' s nothing here that will profoundly move anyone , but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects . situations that initially feel contrived , such as jenny ' s familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) and comet discoverer leo biederman ( elijah wood ) , achieve some poignance ; and even the more vaguely drawn characters , including u . s . president tom beck ( morgan freeman ) , astronaut spurgeon \" fish \" tanner ( robert duvall ) , and his rather faceless crew ( ron eldard , jon favreau , mary mccormack , blair underwood , and alexander baluyev ) aboard the comet - bombing spacecraft messiah , have their share of touching moments . the latter fact owes a debt to the actors , who all do a solid job and are well - cast , with the possible exception of leoni ; she delivers a decent performance , but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster . although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work ( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular ) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister , it is the first of the ' 90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true -- a film that makes a genuine impact , even if it isn ' t as deep as hoped .", "brian de palma , the director who bought us carrie , dressed to kill and mission : impossible is back , and has bought all his technical expertise with him . sadly , he forget to bring a good story and believable characters . nic cage plays rick santaro , a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne ( sinise . ) an assassination takes place , and santaro tries to peace together how it took place , trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy . the film uses flashbacks and video cameras to bring the mystery together . however , the film doesn ' t keep the mystery for long , and once the big ' secret ' is out concerning kevin dunne , the film is at a dead end . although there are some fantastic shots by de palma , including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film , halfway through the film drops dead . the problem is that de palma doesn ' t have a strong story or characters to work with . he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques , but pretty soon this has no effect on the audience , and i quickly got bored . nic cage and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters , but it ' s no use . they are boring , faceless , and completely unlikeable . yes , another problem with the film is that there ' s no - one to root for . we ' re supposed to be on cage ' s side , because his character becomes nicer throughout the film . however , his change is sadly unbelievable . poor gary sinise ' s character is terrible , who completely changes throughout the start , the middle and the end , in an appalling way . the film ' s use of flashback quickly gets boring . while clever and interesting the first few times , it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go . they certainly don ' t increase the tension or suspense of the movie . there is small thread of suspense running through the film , but it certainly doesn ' t make this film a powerhouse thriller , rather just a slightly below average one . the script is lousy and contrived , the characters flat and two dimensional . certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller . the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential . there ' s a good story buried in snake eyes , it ' s just bogged down in razzle dazzle and flashbacks . it also gives itself away far too quickly , rather than leaving the big twist for the end . while the performances are intriguing , especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy ' number cruncher ' wrapped up in the case , there ' s no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case of style of substance , and unless you ' re a big fan of either cage or flash directing , should be avoided . a david wilcock review ? 1998 \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes", "eight years after its release , disney has decided to re - release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only . coincidentally , it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox ' s animated film anastasia was released . you know disney , they can ' t deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old \" masterpiece \" from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox . let no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market . they still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place . believe it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p . m . , i saw the little mermaid for the first time . it took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom ' s friends for a couple weeks . they had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times . by the time i got back home , i promised myself i ' d never see the movie . but promises are made to be broken , especially when you ' re looking at a 17 - day , limited engagement . damn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games . the little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it ' s disney - ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song . it also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times . i never wanted so much to be a pair of shells . . . the heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16 - year - old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase . she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans . she ' s also dealing with feelings she hasn ' t had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you didn ' t use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one ) . her father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the \" savage \" humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not - so - subtle analogy about old - fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating . what ' s a king to do , though ? the girl ' s in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn ' t deter her . ariel saves the prince ' s life when a hurricane rises up , and just has to meet him . she makes a deal with ursula , the sea witch ( voice of pat carroll ) . you know she ' s evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history . she also has octopus tentacles for feet ( something those dr . scholl ' s corn pads will not fix ) and offers to help ariel out . she ' ll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever . and if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she ' ll fall asleep forever . it ' s a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company . it ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the ' 50s . all the elements are there -- memorable songs like \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl , \" cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children . the little mermaid is worth a big -

wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . then , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer - director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . feeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him . red ' s punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d ' onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie ' s dreams . enter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam ' s estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie ' s eye and have sex with her in the bathroom . united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn ' t ready to let them go without a fight . freddie , meanwhile , isn ' t ready to let sam ' s money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations . there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam ' s intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father . it does a great job of setting up jjaks ' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves ' wounded look is just right for jjaks . the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . most important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements ' \" i will dare \" on the car radio . you would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . unfortunately , you would be dead wrong . i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn ' t expect what i got . what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . suddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable . the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . vincent d ' onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme ' s something wild and neil jordan ' s the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn ' t try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . i don ' t want to dismiss baigelman ' s successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well - crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light - hearted caper . it _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can ' t make his two halves into a whole . feeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there ' s not much funny about that .", "very few people would be unaware of beavis & butt - head ( both created and narrated by mike judge ) . they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind . you may have seen them on their television program , as they snigger and make lude remarks about women , anything related to sex , and the music film clips that they watch . in beavis & butt - head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut , to the delight of some , and the deplore of others . beavis & butt - head ( yes , those are their real names ) , are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones . they live their lives in front of the television . the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen . this happens as they sleep , and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone . beavis even tries to use the remote , though there is no television there . the two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television . even at this point they have no idea what has happened . they look around , seeing all the evidence , but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television . before the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i didn ' t realise just how stupid . this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film . eventually they realise that their television has been stolen , so they leave their sofa to go search for a television . luck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife . this man , thinking that beavis & butt - head are the assigned killers , tells them that they can have $ 10 , 000 if they \" do his wife \" . beavis & butt - head , being the ignorant fools that they are , think that he is offering them $ 10 , 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife . they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to \" do her \" . to them , this is the best day of their lives . not only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) , but most importantly , they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv . inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime , and unbeknown to them , are tracked across the country by the fbi . oddly enough , it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught , as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds . they end up travelling right across america , visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc . the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations , their one time out in the big world away from their television , they are completely oblivious to it . at old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra - red operated urinals than with the geyser itself . beavis & butt - head essentially have the journey of their lives . they even get to meet the president . but all they care about is getting their television back , and losing their virginity . this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it ' s unbelievable just how stupid they are , and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them . the humour is certainly crude , but then beavis & butt - head are just that ; crude , lude and rude . in the end you can ' t help but feel sorry for them , a pair of anti - social couch potatoes whose life is television . in this respect , and also with regard to authority ( such as the fbi ) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society . if you are easily offended , or find this pair particularly annoying , steer clear . otherwise , it should keep you laughing the whole way through . one note of warning : don ' t take friends who like to imitate beavis & butt - head . . . . . you ' ll never hear the end of it !", "this talky , terribly - plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux , an ex - new orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder - mystery after a light - plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat . he and his wife annie ( kelly lynch ) rescue a little salvadorian girl ( samantha lagpacan ) from the wreckage and that ' s when the trouble begins . the other major players include a local drug lord ( eric roberts ) , his scheming wife ( teri hatcher ) , a soused stripper ( mary stuart masterson ) , and a shady dea agent ( vondie curtis hall ) . everyone knows everyone else and it makes for a collective that ' s curious but never compelling . based on the book by james lee burke , heaven ' s prisoners is so badly plotted that entire * scenes * seem to be missing . early on , we have no idea of why dave and annie keep the child to themselves . nor how they eluded both the coast guard and the faa . later , dave is reunited with a drug - abuser who appears seemingly clean and sober and without any explanation . huh ? the whole movie is like this , perhaps the result of some unkind cuts that happened during the eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf . whatever the reason , somebody should tell director phil joanou ( final analysis ) to recut this mess . in its present form , heaven ' s prisoners runs only two hours plus change , but it feels like four .", "my friend here in film school just made a two minute - long film for one of his classes that includes a staged anal rape scene , done by two guys and shot on the shadow of the incident , with a banana being used as the instrument of penetration . as sick as this all is , watching it is one of the most admittingly hysterical moments i ' ve ever witnessed . sure , it may be in bad taste , but what the hell is bad taste other than something that may be offensive to some but is riotously amusing to the rest ? then there ' s \" caligula . \" this film features incest , necrophilia , beastuality , anal rape , homosexual felatio of both sexes , elaborate and lengthy orgies , a greased - up fist forced up a man ' s rear , wine poured down a man who ' s had his urinary tracts tied off , a penis chopped off and fed to hungry dogs , etc , etc , etc . this could very well be a respectable film , and if could have been had the following not occurred : a ) the events were graphically shot in clear view ; b ) the tone was not that of trying to shock comically but to , well , show \" historical accuracy ; \" c ) the film was a 20 million dollar production with lavish sets , a rather impressive cast , and a whopping 2 1 / 2 hour running time . produced and funded by none other than bob guccione , owner of penthouse magazine , \" caligula \" comes across as the most hysterical dramatic picture since \" plan 9 from outer space \" because underneath there ' s a sense that everything this film is doing is not only accurate and justified , but also brilliantly entertaining . after all , it ' s not really the fact that this film features the aforementioned disgusting moments , but that it actually believes in them as dramatic weaponry . no film should be discarded because its content , because film is never about what it ' s about , it ' s about how it ' s about ( as the old cliche goes ) . those who bash this film for content are glancing over the biggest and most obvious problem with \" caligula , \" and that ' s that it ' s nothing but overdramaticized bullshit from start to finish , without a second of credibility in its mammoth running time . \" caligula \" allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing . . . or so i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons . the film opens on the wrong note , of course , with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen , using the over - used passage \" what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , \" depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( i suppose if one has to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place ) . the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula ( disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell , a performance that does the opposite that his performance in \" a clockwork orange \" did ) is next in line for the throne but can ' t wait for the current emporer , tiberius ( peter o ' toole - ditto , only for his performance in \" lawrence of arabia \" ) , his grandfather , to die . . . so he kills him and ascends to the throne . then he abuses his position , marries a woman ( helen mirren , who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting ) so he doesn ' t just have to sleep with his sister ( a dreadful teresa ann savoy , there to be pretty , naked , and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with ) , abuses his position a little more , a little more , and a little more , and then , i believe , invades england , then is killed off . the filler , instead of recounting his life , is supposed to be , as guccione claims , the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome , complete with orgies , vicious deaths , and lots of nudity . but instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be , it instead becomes guccione ' s twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like . oh , isn ' t it great that they just loved having sex ? and that they killed people so disgustingly ? and wouldn ' t it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it ' s so blatantly real bad porn that i ' ve completely convinced myself that it ' s not . i mean , why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up . and it ' s not just that it ' s disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it ' s that in a film where the entire feel it ' s going for isn ' t felt , it ' s also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time . the sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this . but that doesn ' t matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just plain dark . the camera operation is also the worst i ' ve ever seen in my entire life . not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of focus . the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow . there is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it ' s \" adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? \" ) , but nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that i can ' t in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face ( my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius : \" he could go at any moment , but with care , he could last a year or so . \" ) the music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian ( they use his gorgeous \" adagio of spartacus and phrygia , \" ad nauseum ) , used in an attempt to give the film some emotion , but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere . the orgy scenes ( and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo ) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself , which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment ( every five seconds or so , the film cuts to random nudity , as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated \" x \" ) . john gielgud represents the only voice of sanity , walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra , \" i ' m going to kill my agent , i ' m going to kill my agent . . . \" and so on and so on , for over 2 1 / 2 hours , making \" caligula \" about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying . guccione , in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking , arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage . throughout the entire film , the presence of guccione is easily felt , as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen , pretentiously looking down upon us saying \" look what i can get away with ! and if you don ' t like this , then you ' re a prig , and worse than that , you know nothing about history ! \" uh huh . there ' s a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that ' s artistically good . a film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last - that would probably make for a good film . but using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgusting - for - disgustingness '- sake acts is total , total bullshit , and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism , and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both , judging from this film . there ' s a film that came out in 1989 called \" the cook , the thief , his wife , and her lover , \" a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway ( also starring helen mirren ) , which deals with graphic sex , heartstopping violence and gore , and even a little cannibalism for good measure . that film not only never patronized its viewers , but also handled them in a way that was shocking , yes , but also , in a bizarre way , entertaining and totally involving . there were real characters there in a real situation , and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that it ' s going to be offensive to many . that film achieved everything it wanted to do , and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good . and it ' s everything \" caligula \" might have been but , alas , wasn ' t .", "\" oh my god , i sounded just like a mother ! \" mrs . pascal , played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold , tells her son . \" didn ' t i sound just like a mother ? \" \" you are a mother , \" her son marty tells her disgustedly . \" i know , but i still can ' t believe it . i look at you people and wonder , how did you ever fit in my womb ? \" marty , you see , is a grown - up twin . although his sister , who thinks she is jackie - o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes . mother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko . most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean - spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is . the daughter ' s fantasy of being jackie - o is probably the most sane part of her being . mrs . pascal is the sort that will not let jackie - o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level . she explains to marty ' s new fiancee , lesly ( tori spelling ) , soon after their first meeting that jackie - o was holding marty ' s private part when she came out of the womb . the dialog by wendy macleod , based on the play by mark waters , is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment . the script , reminiscent of a david mamet play , flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters . the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family ' s out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane . in this storm are two sane individuals . the fiancee is a giddy , school - girl type , embarrassed by everything , a complete contrast to her rival jackie - o ' s bitter pseudo - sophistication . as the two twins ' younger brother , anthony , freddie prinze jr . plays the all - america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother ' s fiancee that night . \" we all have our secrets , \" jackie - o tells her potential sister - in - law , and boy , does she have a few . this is a house filled with them . ( when lesly calls it the family ' s \" home \" to mrs . pascal -- they ' ve never had a visitor before lesly -- mrs . pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their \" house . \" ) in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase , \" made for each other , \" the twin ' s biggest , but not their only secret , is that they ' ve had a long - term incestuous relationship . they don ' t like to discuss it , although they are not particularly ashamed of it . perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy , this story never pulls its punches . jackie - o tries in many ways , few subtle , to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his . in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie - o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands . marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy . the chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing . they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world . their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best . director mark waters keeps the show ' s energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace . his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it . jackie - o is temperamentally incapable of being nice . and being jealous , she cuts lesly down mercilessly . \" were you poor ? \" jackie - o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished . \" did you eat pies ? chicken pot pies ? \" \" pancakes actually , lots of pancakes , \" lesly replies with her usual sincerity . \" a donut king , so is she like the queen ? , \" jackie - o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king . \" are we entertaining royalty ? \" with rolfe kent ' s whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed . will it end in a big emotional explosion , a murder , people slowly cutting each other up with words , a familial catharsis , a weather disaster or what ? the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere , and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell . i ' ll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise . the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1 : 25 . it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations , mature themes , violent overtones and some profanity . the movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers , i . e . , treat the movie as it were rated nc - 17 .", "the kids in the hall are an acquired taste . it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer . maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies , they would grow into the big screen . my recommendation is that , unless you are a big fan of the kids , skip the film . as it is , their first -- and most likely only -- attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv . a big - budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show . the kids go through the motions , but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so . and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics . brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression . in typical sketch - comedy tradition , each actor plays several roles . doctor cooper ( kevin mcdonald ) and his team create the drug . then , under pressure from don roritor ( mark mckinney ) , founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals , dr . cooper releases the drug into the marketplace . the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film . at about 90 minutes , brain candy still seems long . the best thing about sketch comedy -- and the kids are no exception -- is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs , then go on to another quick skit . but with the additional set - up necessary in telling a longer , coherent story , the laughs just dont come fast enough . strangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv . the movie makes several attempts at risqueness -- mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters -- but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating . one of the best bits , though , does make use of thompsons naked buttocks ; we see him charging into battle -- going to have sex with some guys taking a shower . in the classic of this genre , monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail . the kids , unfortunately , are not up to the task . there are some amusing moments , to be sure , but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one .", "go ' s is a gloriously slick hip machine . director liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug / rave scene in l . a . , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them . after more than ninety minutes of pill - popping , tantric sex , car chases , and attempted murder , go even has a happy ending . this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down , i anticipated an anti - pill - popping - casual - tantric - sex - car - chase - attempted - murder sermon that ( blessedly ) didn ' t arrive . a la tarantino ' s pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories . the basics are as follows : ronna ( polley ) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough . her co - worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas . zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career - threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust . perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino ' s non - linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id - fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind - reading cat ! ) ; pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go ' s wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last . torontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was \" not pleased with \" her turn as the ill - fated cashier . in go , she delivers , hands - down , her best performance to date . here ' s an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you . if she doesn ' t want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said \" no , \" not go . but i digress . go is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one can ' t help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride . in that sense , it ' s a departure from liman ' s last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self - absorption in the form of vince vaughan ' s trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story ' s clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald ' s for their latest commercial ) . i wish i cared more about go ' s characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous . when the lights came up and stung my eyes , it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me . yet entertain me it did . go is light and frothy , featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley , timothy olyphant ( scream 2 ) , and especially fichtner , whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs . fichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers ( in heat , armageddon , and others ) ; his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go . unlike much of the film , fichtner is unpredictable .", "jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today . from time - to - time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances . on the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw - droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis ' king kong . and , much as lange would probably prefer movie - goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality . hush is one such example . lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn ' t such a prime example of motion picture tedium . the film opens , as many so - called \" psychological thrillers \" do , by posing as a light drama . we are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks ' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love . jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) . the moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs . soon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) . once that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives . as long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it ' s a declaration of war . hush has three very simple problems : it ' s incredibly dumb , it ' s incredibly boring , and it ' s incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) . this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow - covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow ' s bare buttocks . frankly , it ' s embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange ' s stature give a performance like this -- it ' s like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) . meanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object . as in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn . here , it ' s mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle . of course , since schaech ' s character is poorly - developed and badly acted , it ' s impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation . maybe someone should ask him if he ' s familiar with oedipus . martha is , of course , the evil one . how do we know she ' s evil ? she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work . on the other hand , helen is a good girl . the evidence for this is that she ' s nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents . that ' s about it for character development . beyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard - to - swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists . however , the first 85 minutes are just a warm - up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying . i can ' t imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion . either there was some serious last - minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script . before the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it . viewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is . cheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable . most entries into this worn - out , worm - eaten genre aren ' t especially good . films like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along . in general , however , they ' re directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension . that ' s not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care . indeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid .", "the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment . with she ' s all that and varsity blues behind us , and several more set for release later in the year , the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance . however , you wouldn ' t know it from the quality of the latest entry : jawbreaker . this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center . the most popular , and most feared , clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma . they have accidentally killed one of their own , the \" teen dream \" , liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) , choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday . now the three surviving girls must decide what to do . it takes little time at all for the group ' s leader , courtney ( rose mcgowan ) , to decide to cover it up . the ditzy marcie ( julie benz ) is game to go along , but the clique ' s final member , julie ( rebecca gayheart ) , has a guilty conscience . to make things worse , another student , the hopelessly geeky fern mayo ( judy evans greer ) accidentally discovers the truth . the girls ' cover is surely blown . . . not so fast . thinking quickly , courtney offers fern a once - in - a - lifetime chance . after a quick makeover , fern is transformed into vylette , the beautiful \" new girl \" at school , and a full - fledged member of the popular crowd . does this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder ? or will this finely honed plan crack over time ? jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation , and failing miserably , i might add . it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations , but misses three crucial elements : sharp dialogue , witty characters and the much - needed humor . it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being ( darkly ) humorous if it wasn ' t shackled to its dead - weight plot . the film ' s most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo . at this point , jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths . but then , all of a sudden , the innovation stops . the film becomes mired in the murder - and - cover - up plotting , which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film . in the film , rose mcgowan fares the best . as the manipulative clique leader , she truly dominates every scene she ' s in ( not a difficult feat in a crowd such as this , however ) . it ' s a character crying out for a better movie ( or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact . ) jawbreaker doesn ' t quite know how to handle its semi - likable characters : fern and julie . either one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows . the lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters . as their motives become murky and unclear , the film finally falls to the point that it doesn ' t really matter who wins or loses , since all sides have become equally detestable . \" detestable \" is a good word to describe the film , jawbreaker . it ' s certain that , like the murder weapon described in the film ' s title , jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience .", "godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the \" who cares about plot \" summer movie . a loose remake of the 1954 \" classic \" japanese monster movie , godzilla , king of the monsters ( which is itself pretty thin in the story department ) , roland emmerich and dean devlin ' s big - budget lizard - stomps - manhattan disaster flick has been written with the brain dead in mind . the script isn ' t just \" dumbed down , \" it ' s lobotomized . godzilla lives and dies on special effects alone . presumably , the primary target group for this film is teenage boys , the demographic most likely to shell out $ 7 repeatedly to see the same images of monster - instigated carnage . that ' s not to say that females and other age groups are immune to the special effects seduction ; they ' re just not as readily susceptible . this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer - generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors . stargate was a financial success . independence day was a runaway hit . and , with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie - ins before it even opens , it ' s virtually guaranteed at least $ 100 million . nice numbers for a film that could have been penned by a not - too - precocious grade school kid . godzilla isn ' t completely without merit , although it is close . there ' s a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan , but it wears off quickly . frankly , while the special effects are competent , they ' re not all that stunning . there ' s nothing new here ; it ' s jurassic park meets aliens , with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure . maybe it will require george lucas and his new star wars movie to take computer - generated visuals to the next level . godzilla never really pushes the envelope , preferring to remain within a comfort zone . the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass , formulaic approach which disallows creativity . ( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ) worst of all , godzilla isn ' t even exciting . with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end , there isn ' t a sequence in this film that raises the pulse . even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn - provoking . independence day may have been dumb , but it was full of \" adrenaline moments \" capable of getting the audience involved in the action . in this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking . actually , part of the problem is that we ' re never sure who we ' re supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper - thin humans trying to stop him . the plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply . after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple . he does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway . in the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams . on hand to stop him is an elite u . s . army unit , led by a slightly less - arrogant - than - usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla . in his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific . in nick ' s words , godzilla is \" a mutated aberration ? an incipient creature ? the first of its kind . \" as luck would have it , nick ' s old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station . along with her cameraman friend , animal ( hank azaria ) , she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla . then , just when the military has rejected nick ' s theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment . instead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city . unfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it ' s becoming boring . the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall . he could climb the empire state building . at ten times that height , godzilla would be more likely to knock it over . godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor . there ' s an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit - com material , an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick ' s last name properly , and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel . both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film : \" ebert , \" the mayor of new york , is played by michael lerner , and \" gene \" ( lorry goldman ) is his campaign manager . ebert ' s re - election slogan is , not surprisingly , \" thumbs up for new york . \" the siskel / ebert stuff is amusing the first time it ' s used , but , after a while , it grows tiresome . and , although the \" characters \" don ' t serve any real purpose , they keep popping up . godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast . this is largely because emmerich doesn ' t want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard . that ' s not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren ' t capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting in the past ) , but they aren ' t a - list names . then again , considering the quality of the writing , even pacino and deniro would have been hard - pressed to shine . maria pitillo ( dear god ) plays the love interest and hank azaria ( great expectations ) is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief . ultimately , it doesn ' t really matter what i ( or any other critic , for that matter ) have to say about the movie . tristar has assumed that godzilla , like all self - proclaimed summer event motion pictures , is pretty much critic - proof . it may also be word - of - mouth - proof . those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friends say . so , when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies of all time , it ' s like spitting into the wind . emmerich and devlin are master illusionists , waving their wands and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke and mirrors . it ' s probably too much to hope that some day , movie - goers will wake up and realize that they ' ve been had .", "the camera zooms in incredibly close . it focuses on the closed eyes of a person presumed dead . all of a sudden , with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse , his eyelids open . the camera zooms in incredibly close . it focuses on one of the characters desperately running for her life . then , with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse , she bumps into the killer . the camera zooms in incredibly close . it focuses on a door from where seemingly strange sounds emanate . all of a sudden , with a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse , the doors swing open to reveal what ' s inside . close - up thrill - shots such as these seemed to elicit more laughter from the audience rather than genuine fear , which is a pretty good sign that you ' re not watching the thriller that the director had originally envisioned . rather , you adopt the opinion that the characters are so goofy and so unaware of the trouble that they ' re in , that you stop caring about who lives , who dies and where the story goes . instead , you become more interested in how the characters get killed off . the four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs for this movie are helen and barry and julie and ray - two couples and dear friends to one another . during the summer just after high school graduation , they take a fateful drive down a dark mountain highway . suddenly , without warning , their car hits someone whom the teens presume was killed as a result of that collision . fearing jail time and possible manslaughter charges if they confess , they instead decide to dump the body into the ocean and make a pact never to discuss the episode again . a year goes by and things among the four friends begin to change . relationships fizzle , future dreams crumble , and attitudes change . but , they can not forget what they did . and apparently , neither can someone else . someone begins to send letters to all four of the teens with the frightening message : \" i know what you did last summer . \" the letter - writer ( a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a large metal hook ) soon makes his presence known and begins to hunt down the four teens . it ' s now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer is before it ' s too late . while this movie has some nice visually eerie effects , too much of it ' s impact had to be generated with extreme close - ups , while the level of suspense was choppy at best . there is so much more that this movie could have been , but decided to give us nothing but cheap thrills . it could have been a clever whodunit , but discovering who ultimately was the killer made me just shrug my shoulders . it could have explored the changed friendships after a year of adulthood , but seemed to only include that aspect to add 15 more minutes to the film . it could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you ' re alone and you see shadowy figures moving about , you don ' t walk towards them yelling \" hello \" . once you yell \" hello \" , you can expect an extreme close - up , a thunderous sound effect and an eerie sounding musical pulse . it ' s difficult to be in suspense when you know what ' s about to happen . the only redeeming aspect of the movie is that i now have a neat idea for a halloween costume , but i ' m not sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers and hooks . the horror that i experienced from this film is realizing that i actually went to see it .", "seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p . m . at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater # 2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony / loews critic ' s pass . [ theater rating : * * 1 / 2 : okay seats , sound , and picture ] modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc - 17 - rated films about fetishes . the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it . \" your friends and neighbors \" takes a different approach as it ' s a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends . one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer / director neil labute ' s basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story . firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras . everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full - circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative . but to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult . labute ' s ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what ' s specifically impressive is the fact the characters ' names are never revealed until the end credits roll . for the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus . we ' re always able to tell where the characters are ( someone ' s home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown . the film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater . no one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background . we ' re simply dropped in on the characters ' lives and are expected to figure out the rest . the characters are a group of middle - class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they ' re only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . first there ' s barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don ' t know what they ' re problem is . barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn ' t have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn ' t hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . labute ' s script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors ' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . if only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . it ' s natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ? what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ? labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it ' s fascinating . two other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) . cary is an arrogant , hostile sex - maniac who defines the word \" bastard . \" somehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way . he ' s the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he ' s secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him . patric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is . cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her . she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another . she ' s a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable . i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others ' action , as that ' s the hook of the film . the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each ' s scenarios , but it ' s often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom . the result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating . for a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character ' s guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them . one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be . since the characters only interact with each other there isn ' t much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it . are we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ? i don ' t know of anyone going through the same situations as these people . often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie . but what this film does have that the others don ' t is repercussions in the end . although the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren ' t immortal . in what way \" your friends and neighbors \" is supposed to work is open to interpretation . it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically . still , it ' s an accomplishment in film - making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective .", "for many people , procrastination isn ' t a problem to overcome , it ' s a high art . we ' ll do just about anything to put off a task . when the deadline for this column nears , it ' s the only time during the week dishes get washed and the bed made and laundry done and plants watered and . . . eventually , hopefully , sometimes , there ' s a breakthrough and we actually get down to work . amazingly it ' s almost always easier than we dreaded and after finishing , that sense of oppressive apprehension melts away . and then , the next time , we do it all again . english professor grady tripp ( michael douglas ) is a master . seven years ago , his first book was a hit . he ' s been working on his second -- a short 200 - page piece -- since then . fearful that he can ' t live up to the first , he can ' t bring himself to finish it . no writer ' s block , he ' s nearing 3 , 000 pages with no end in sight . now he ' s having a particularly difficult day . the college ' s annual writers conference is bringing in accomplished novelists reminding tripp that other people are finishing _their_ books . during the first day , his wife has left him , his married girlfriend informs him she ' s pregnant and his agent is in town with a six - foot transvestite in tow . by the evening , our besieged writer is driving though the snow - covered streets of pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him , a stolen jacket that marilyn monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat and a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk . this could be a pivotal point in his mid - life crisis . and then there ' s the next morning . there ' s a lot to like about this movie . there are no huge explosions , shattering glass or computer - generated dinosaurs to distract from the very real human issues . grady is caught up in the curse of people who accomplish great things early in their career . in the world of \" what have you done for me lately ? \" , he knows his second book has to be better than his first . instead of finding out , he drifts , comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood . he doesn ' t have much of a life and neither does his star pupil james leer ( tobey maguire ) . james may be suicidal and psychotic . certainly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie . he makes up a past of working clash anguish because the truth of wealth and comfort just isn ' t interesting enough . as the weekend progresses , they are both forced to fully engage life . that ' s the question they must face : comfort or real experiences ? the film takes some interesting chances . non - traditional relationships are presented as matter - of - fact . extra - marital , gay , interracial , professor - student : here they aren ' t judged , merely choices . the actors are all first - rate . douglas triumphs , playing against type as he spends most of his time disheveled , unshaven and clad in a pink women ' s house robe . maguire ' s disengaged alienation works perfectly here . robert downey jr . as grady ' s agent livens up his scenes . director curtis hanson ( \" l . a . confidential \" ) makes a few missteps . the women are underused . frances mcdormand does a good job of her limited role of sara , grady ' s married lover but we never understand much of who she is . the chemistry between the two of them is non - existent which makes some of the ending unconvincing . katie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor , but her character goes nowhere . we never even see grady ' s exiting wife . this is very much a guy ' s film . the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others . grady ' s alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film , not him and sara . as the boomers age , expect to see more mid - life crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic . eventually it ' ll probably become cliche , but right now we ' ve got a winner . i ' ll finish this in a second . right now i have to grab some paint . i noticed some trim in the other room that needs a little touch - up .

as was i . i can ' t tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year . time alone will make that call . but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank ' s side . we were concerned for his well - being , and wanted him to win . that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last . the truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot . unless you ' re under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics . carrey stars as truman burbank , a capra - esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner ' s idea of the perfect american small town . truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co - workers . there is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good . but then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky . this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world ' s biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world ' s most popular television program . what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir . the soundstage , we ' re told , is \" only the second man - made structure visible from space . \" truman ' s movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams . weir cuts the film so we ' re never quite sure if we ' re watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show ' s omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man - made moon in seahaven ' s sky . the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence . his best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him . his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product . he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town . one wonders why he didn ' t pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : \" people tend to accept the reality with which they ' re presented . \" nevertheless , truman begins to grow restless , and dreams of escape to fiji , where an old college sweetheart ( natasha mcelhone ) supposedly lives . this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way . by underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over . there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon , and marlon answers with best - friend sincerity , \" i ' d gladly step in front of a bus for you . \" but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof . the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home - and from that moment , we ' re on his side . the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies - haven ' t we all , at least once , doubted our place in the world , doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ? ultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator . what does god really think of us ? does he resent our abandonment of paradise ? who exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ? if you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work . as for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play . carrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn ' t try to be . he just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us .", "it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k : tm . he had never seen any episodes of the show , and i have watched a scant few , due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes . for those of you not familiar with the premise , dr clayton forrester ( beaulieu ) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public . to achieve this , he ( in the words of the tv series ' theme , which is missing in the movie ) \" bumped [ mike nelson ( nelson ) ] on the noggin and then shot him into space \" , and is monitoring nelson ' s reactions to the movies he is forced to endure . rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies , nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions , tom servo and crow t . robot . the format of the show consists of nelson , servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched , and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love , the ship on which our heroes are marooned . only two things are different in the movie : the absence of forrester ' s sidekick , tv ' s frank , and the slower pace of the jokes . this latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke . for their big screen outing , the producers have chosen \" this island earth \" , a 1954 classic , and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill . unfortunately for that film ( but making it ideal mst3k fodder ) , acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which , by today ' s standards , are less than impressive . nelson & co . make jokes about everything from japan ' s dominance in the world market , to star trek , to the state of disrepair of seattle ' s kingdome , and most of them work . unfortunately , the segments set outside the satellite ' s movie theater seem out of place and aren ' t particularly funny , but at least they ' re fairly short . the big question about this movie though is : why ? i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series ( rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago ) , but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen -- there are no special effects to dazzle you , no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat , and no use of digital surround sound . so , it seems pointless to spend $ 8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for $ 3 , and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts . nevertheless , mst3k : tm provides more laugh - out - loud opportunities than any film you ' re going to see this year , and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse . given its uniqueness , i hesitate to grade it against other films , but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of \" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b -

standard comedy . moving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts . val is monica ' s cousin and a true fan of the new york scene . on the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can ' t find . paradoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren ' t successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds . of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot . wisely , the movie ' s creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless . paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship . however , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening . finally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub - plot of the film . jack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy ' s virginity the night before . while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy . very often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory . however , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted . instead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies . first , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot . at other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot . there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish . not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver . and yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots . perhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end . but it didn ' t happen that way . the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight .", "set in the wild west , this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid ( sidney james ) and his cronies in stodge city . his dodgy dealings and summary shootings aggravate judge burke ( kenneth williams ) so much that he asks sheriff albert earp ( jon pertwee ) to drive rumpo out of town . instead , the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead . therefore , judge burke sends for a law marshall to come in and clean up the city . due to a misunderstanding , an english sanitary engineer called marshall p . knutt ( jim dale ) is assigned , without knowing it , as the law marshall for stodge city . he arrives at the same time as annie oakley ( angela douglas ) who is seeking revenge for her father , the sheriff ' s murder . when marshall arrives at stodge city , he soon becomes aware of the misunderstanding and due to his rather limited intellect , he is manipulated by the rumpo kid and always ends up getting things wrong . in the end , there is a head - to - head between rumpo and marshall . with the rumpo ' s past experience , it would seem that marshall is out of his depth , but using his sanitary skills and learning the ways of the west from annie oakley , he at least stands some chance ! sid james , with an american accent , is perfect as the rumpo kid , a part which suits him down to the ground . jim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer , and angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter . other regulars that appear in this movie include charles hawtrey and bernard bresslaw ( in his debut ) as big heap and little heap respectively . big heap is the local indian leader and the crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is very amusing , as is his performance : - he steals every scene he is in even though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past . joan sims provides useful and amusing support as belle , the local bar owner who takes a fancy to the rumpo kid . however , the part of doc played by peter butterworth and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary , and pertwee ' s performance is rather poor . kenneth williams uses a new voice but struggles with the weak part of the ' judge ' . even so , this carry on was sid james and kenneth williams ' favourite . a very different carry on film , in that it is played more seriously by the actors and possesses more realism than any other carry on . the death count is the highest of any carry on film . sets , costumes and action sequences are all very commendable . the songs that are included in the movie ( the title song and annie ' s song ) are very impressive . a strange but therefore very interesting carry on film . not the best of its kind but it is certainly the most distinctive film of the series .", "warning : contains what the matrix is . rated r for sci -

plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction . since then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co - director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire - fest , from dusk till dawn . in between , he has moonlighted as an \" actor \" with several decidedly unmemorable performances . now , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown . and , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard ' s novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed . for the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie . the story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double - crosses and triple - crosses . and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , ' 70s pop tunes , and close - ups of womens ' bare feet . yet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown . the sheer , in - your - face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent . the mostly - straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn ' t match up favorably to the non - linear style of tarantino ' s previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives . and there aren ' t nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around . there ' s a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson / chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson / robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson / travolta material from pulp fiction , but that ' s about it . jackie brown ' s lone \" innovation \" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives . this isn ' t exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa ' s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick ' s courage under fire . however , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points - of - view , tarantino ' s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it ' s unconventional . had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost . as a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity . for the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a ' 70s icon . this time around , instead of john travolta , it ' s blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) . in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier ' s career , tarantino uses a ' 70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits . there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt - kicking ) . grier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states . she ' s working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official . no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv ' s \" banyon \" ) to post the necessary $ 10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal . jackie passes ordell ' s test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $ 500 , 000 of ordell ' s money into the united states without tipping off the feds . soon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell ' s perpetually oversexed and drugged - out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right - hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) . unsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn ' t nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction . in addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar - caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) . robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough - guys - who - rarely - smile roles . bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino ' s foot fetish . robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy - looking , middle - aged actor . the film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two - and - a - half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) . tarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself . when it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second - tier effort . it ' s an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender .", "you know you ' re in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in question ' s most normal character . such is the case with \" the big lebowski , \" joel and ethan coen ' s first venture since their \" fargo \" nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece of academy award nods . there ' s no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment , because \" lebowski \" is an effort that makes words like \" strange \" and \" unusual \" seem like an understatement . thanks in part to delicious characterization and an all - encompassing sense of humor , the film is a smashing success . the central oddball here is the dude ( jeff bridges ) , an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot , drinking beer and going bowling ( are you college students already rooting for him , or what ? ) . one night , a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet , a threatening act that ' s supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire ( david huddleston ) who shares his birth name -- jeff lebowski -- with the dude . once the dude realizes this coincidence , he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug , and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter ( john goodman ) , a hotheaded vietnam vet , and donny ( buscemi ) , a mild - mannered surfer , before too long . soon , though , lebowski ' s trampy trophy wife bunny ( tara reid ) is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom , and he turns to the dude for help . it seems bunny ' s troubles are related to a line of work she ' s kept secret from her husband -- she ' s actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn . the dude , now on lebowski ' s payroll , accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop ; walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself . chaos obviously ensues , and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops , crooks and lebowski ' s ultra - eccentric artist daughter maude ( julianne moore ) . \" the big lebowski \" deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that \" fargo \" did ; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film , \" lebowski \" is at least as breathtakingly imaginative . the movie boasts a mile - high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over , but thankfully never does . the coens ( joel directed , ethan produced and both wrote ) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale , and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick . whether we ' re watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley - esque dream sequence , \" the big lebowski \" is immensely lively . there are those who will dislike this film , but not because it ' s boring . the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they ' re given . bridges exudes a likeable , surprisingly sweet presence ; his dude sure isn ' t the cleanest guy around , but you ' d still follow him to another movie . goodman merits 1998 ' s first oscar consideration , as walter ' s manic temper is one of \" the big lebowski \" ' s many highlights ; the same goes for moore , whose throaty , delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot . john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction . sam elliott ' s rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start . and some will recognize peter stormare -- \" fargo \" ' s silent heavy -- as carl hungus , a porn star who ' s really a samurai sword - wielding german nihilist and has - been pop star . only in its final third does the movie falter , with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call . these flaws are forgivable , though -- the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it ' s hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face . without a doubt , \" the big lebowski \" is the best film so far this year . sure , we ' re only three months in and the competition ( \" deep rising , \" \" desperate measures , \" \" the wedding singer , \" etc . ) has been pretty bland , but it ' s still the gospel truth . maybe during next awards season , \" lebowski \" won ' t be a far cry from \" fargo . \"", "capsule : a ham - handed and over / underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn ' t even know what it ' s really advocating , if anything . a time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it ' s easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it ' s ostensibly about some important social issue that we ' re all tangling with . it is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i ' ve listed above have something to do with why . right from the beginning , the movie is dead - set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible . a pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead . after their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial . mcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics . the acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have . sandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey ' s accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he ' s given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey ' s role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box . the most memorable role is donald sutherland ' s , and his is a bit part . i always consider it an index of a movie ' s desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact . there is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this . because the movie doesn ' t know what it ' s really about , it * can ' t * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting . one of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross - burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic . i was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention - getter . the movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes . first of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there ' s no tension in his dilemma . he ' s self - admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade . the old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it ' s never developed into an organic component of the story . it just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics . another mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson ' s character . i ' m probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that ' s precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible . ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . ) is jackson ' s character then simply insane ? that prospect isn ' t given terribly serious treatment either . one of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information . mcconaughey ' s character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense . how did the prosecution get this information ? how come he didn ' t get it ? the whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie ' s way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam - bang fashion . this is the biggest problem : the movie isn ' t about jackson ' s character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters . it ' s not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared - down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending . at two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there ' s endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter . it ' s all handwaving . the closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair . it ' s not easy to make a movie about something . the other day i saw kurosawa ' s phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don ' t ) . a time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i ' ve seen in a long time .", "according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being . even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god - forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience . on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view . this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life . the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense . instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters . although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14 - year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini ' s fascist regime . amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don ' t like federico fellini ' s work very much . every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible . distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word \" amarcord \" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase \" i remember \" in local italian dialect . in the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it . after the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn ' t matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini ' s childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film . fellini ' s views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film . even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images . characters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta ' s sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions . every now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie ' s characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters ' visions . because of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life . even the fascism gets fellinian make - over - fellini views mussolini ' s totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy . when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour . unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn ' t care that much about politics . lack of self - righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini ' s humanistic approach to his characters . each of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears . fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people . because of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments . fellini couldn ' t produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie . vignettes aren ' t memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character ' s fantasies . fellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright - coloured beach or rural countryside . even the down - to - earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall . on the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene . this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini ' s long - time associate nino rota . his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced . that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art .", "\" desperate measures \" is a generic title for a film that ' s beyond generic . it ' s also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once - cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not - cool flicks -- this thriller is more \" before and after \" than \" reversal of fortune . \" the movie is a big disappointment , and yet it ' s somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing . too bad the execution ' s all wrong , though , because the set - up of \" desperate measures \" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use . san francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission . even worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society . connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he ' s at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital . when he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy . one misstep \" desperate measures \" makes is in its underdevelopment of matt ' s illness . what ' s needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow . take , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital . the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ? he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight . connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son . whatever . to be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie ' s problems . first and foremost is how cheaply \" desperate measures \" trades the potential of it ' s opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour . once mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills . there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away . also , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot - inducing , lip - smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia ' s frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; \" desperate measures \" appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie ' s head - scratcher of a send - off confirms this . there is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department . cast against type , michael keaton ' s understated menace is highly effective . although he ' s not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord . joseph cross , as garicia ' s ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos . this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but most is lost . it goes without saying that \" desperate measures \" needs an operation of its very own .", "the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways . in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others . this movie closely resembles a james bond flick . it has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal . kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations . the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests . as a young boy , kilmer ' s character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork . that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name , that of a catholic saint . he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be . this leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life . kilmer ' s first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija . during a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles . once his mission is completed and he is safely home , the fee is paid . when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $ 50 million , he decides to carry out only one more mission , then retire . dr . emma russell , portrayed by elisabeth shue , has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion . this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia , where millions are without heat and are freezing to death . the only problem is , tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people . this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal . tretiak hires him to steal the equations , small pieces of paper , from shue . one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions . they are very convincing , not only to the characters in the movie , but to us . kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue ' s character into getting to know him even more , which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula . when the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer ' s character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer ' s alter - ego , a traveling artist . yet , he must reach his goal of $ 50 million , which requires him to steal the energy formula , putting his feelings aside . shue ' s character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces ( the names of the catholic saints ) together , something no one else is able to do . when she finds him , they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak . the saint is very action - packed , with few slow points . the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments . along the course of the movie , there are even a few , although brief moments of comedy . these moments are almost always thanks to kilmer ' s extraneous , very convincing disguises and personalities . all in all , a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non - stop action .", "part one of \" the strangest movies ever made \" series at www . mediajunkies . com by scott watson [ light spoilers , nothing you shouldn ' t read ] existenz has been called \" a gooey matrix \" , and while this is a correct description in some ways , in others it is completely off . the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal , \" real \" reality . a major difference is that \" the matrix \" has a base reality that is obviously the true reality , while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true . and oh what a reality it is . david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies ( naked lunch , crash ) , but this one is one of the strangest . maybe it ' s because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre . technology is organic , but only some of it . cars are normal . gas stations are the same . cell phones are glowing bug like appendages . you jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus ( referred to simply as a \" pod \" ) . high technology has been replaced with organic creatures , and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters . a famous game designer , allegra geller ( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh ) , flees a demonstration of her latest game , existenz , after an assassination attempt . she is on the run ( from who , i ' m still not sure ) , and has to save her pod by playing her game with \" someone friendly \" . that someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard , ted pikul ( jude law ) . unfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement for playing , a bioport . sort of a hole in your spine ( ok , exactly like a hole in your spine ) , a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail - looking wires from the pod into you , allowing you to play the game . luckily a bioport can be installed easily ( they install them in malls ) , so off they go to get one . after a crazy series of events at the local country gas station , they are able to plug in and play existenz . the plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies , reality distortion , chinese restaurants , and multi appendaged amphibian things ( \" it ' s a sign of the times \" ) . but the plot , while cohesive in it ' s own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe . cronenberg just slaps this weird organic - tech world into the viewers lap , and it ' s up to you to figure out how all these things work . and that ' s the true joy of this film , entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place . you learn a little bit piece by piece ( oh , they make pods out of those ) , and it ' s just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you . there are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around , including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards . also the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz , the specifics of which i will leave for you to discover . there ' s lots of little things that set off the weird - o - meter , like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store , the two headed amphibian creature , and why that guy at the gas station ' s name appears to be \" gas \" . it all adds up to a supremely far out trip , and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrix ' s virtual world . . . oh wait , i already do .", "carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town , she goes to college in california . there she meets the residential advisor pauly shore , who is a city boy . when gugino goes back home for thanksgiving , she brings shore with her , and her parents ( lane smith and cindy pickett ) are less than thrilled . dan gauthier , gugino ' s boyfriend from high school , proposes to gugino . gugino isn ' t ready for anything like this so she makes up the story that she is engaged to shore . she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end . forget jurassic park , cliffhanger , the firm and last action hero , son - in - law is the film to see this summer . son - in - law is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers , especially fans of the wiez . when son - in - law is long gone and forgotten , the blockbuster summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see them then . this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it . nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen . although the basic story line has been done many , many times before , the film is still fun to watch . the laughs are plentiful , especially when the wiez is around . the way some of the jokes are done are new , even though some of the jokes are old . there are also several new jokes that , at least , i haven ' t seen before . still , when presented right , even old material can be funny still . this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesn ' t contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price . the cast for this film does an excellent job . pauly shore ( encino man ) is the star attraction of this film . he is great , and knows how to entertain the audience . pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are hilarious . this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role . carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl . she makes her character believable , on some levels , yet interesting at the same time . the person who played the grandfather ( mason adams , i believe ) also does a great job . the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on the screen . patrick renna , who played gugino ' s little brother , was a little annoying , but no where as near as macaulay culkin , and for only part of the time , so i can forgive him . tiffani - amber thiessen ( a killer among friends , \" saved by the bell \" ) does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen . she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on television . she wasn ' t given overly much to do in the film , but what she had , she does a good job with .", "two party guys bob their heads to haddaway ' s dance hit \" what is love ? \" while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub . it ' s barely enough to sustain a three - minute _saturday_night_live_ skit , but _snl_ producer lorne michaels , _clueless_ creator amy heckerling , and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution ' s recurring \" roxbury guys \" sketch that would presumably make a good feature . emphasis on the word \" presumably . \" _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already - thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point -- and that of viewers ' patience levels . the first five minutes or so of _roxbury_ play very much like one of the original \" roxbury guys \" skits . with \" what is love ? \" blaring on the soundtrack , the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrell ) bob their heads , scope out \" hotties \" at clubs , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts . there is one crucial difference , however -- these guys speak . that little fact has been used as justification for the film ' s existence , that the butabis ' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters . the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren , ferrell , and kattan are new , that ' s for sure , but they all lead to comic dead ends . there is no story per se , only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots . the brothers literally run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame , and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club . there , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicuously uncredited -- can you blame him ? ) , who takes an interest in an idea of theirs . meanwhile , the bros ' overbearing father ( dan hedaya ) wants them to stop clubbing . when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father , a rift is created between the two . the narrative messiness of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny , but virtually none of it is . the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film , with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end . alas , the joke -- a rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire_ -- will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film . granted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film ' s best joke is completely dependent on one ' s familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_ ' s lack of inspiration . that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves . like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , \" the roxbury guys \" is a one - joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context . after watching one of the \" roxbury \" skits on snl , this is what you come away with from the characters : they bob their heads to \" what is love ? \" , bump unsuspecting women , and . . . that ' s all . after watching _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ , you ' ll be left with exactly the same .", "can you say \" dated \" ? you can if you ' ve seen rosemary ' s baby which , like the exorcist , was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release . \" mystery science theater 3000 \" has skewered the bad films of the past , but let me tell you , it could do a number on the \" good \" ones too . rosemary ' s baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good - looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not - so - innocent husband ( john cassavettes ) , an actor who takes an easy , albeit evil , road to success . it all seems so harmless in the beginning . mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed . ( there ' s also a skull in the living room , but it ' s only for decoration . ) their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming . all ' s well for about the first hour of this slow - moving film , until mia eats some of the neighbors ' chocolate mousse and passes out . when she comes to , she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big , evil man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen . it seems like a dream and , when she finds herself pregnant , she almost forgets about it . and everyone ' s helping with the pregnancy . the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink , a good - luck charm for her to wear around her neck , and the name of an obstetrician who ' s been in the business 66 . 6 years . meanwhile , mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight . before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries . that ' s when you know your health ' s failing . the only person in the movie who ' s the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend ( maurice evans ) who calls mia up to give her the bad news -- and immediately falls into a coma . by about the two - hour mark i felt the same way . rosemary ' s baby is way too long , and leads up to a payoff that ' s about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie . i guess someone put a spell on this movie .", "another ' independent film ' , this comedy , which was brought by miramax for $ 5 million , is good fun . favreau and vaughn ( the lost world : jurassic park , 1997 ) play mike and trent , two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women . the film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve , and along the way we get to meet some of their friends , see their attempts at chatting up girls , and just basically get a insight into their lives . and all of this is great fun . swingers doesn ' t rely on huge special effects , or big name stars to provide entertainment . no , it just has a great script and superb little known actors . the script , by favreau , is great . mike is always missing is girlfriend , who hasn ' t called him for six months , and every time he meets a girl , he always end up telling her about the ex . the audience feels for this pathetic little man , thanks to the great script . vaughn is ' the money ' ( swingers speak for ' the best ' ) as the womanizing trent , always on the lookout for a new girl . some of his chat - up lines are awful , but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his ' hard man ' nature . vaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film , towards the end in a diner . the conversations that go on between mike and trent are great , but it never quite reaches tarantino standards ( which i suspect the film was trying to reach . ) there are some excellent , laugh out loud jokes in the film , and some superbly funny set pieces ( such as favreau cringe - worhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence . embarrassing to him , hilarious to the audience . ) mike & trents friends are also good , although there characters seem a bit underwritten , and we never really learn as much as we would like about them . although this is primarily mike and trents film , it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends . they just seem to wander aimlessly in the background . but again , the lines they say are usually pretty good , and they do have some funny parts . it ' s just a shame that they didn ' t have more meatier roles . the acting is superb . as said above , vaughn is superb as trent , he ' s definitely the best thing in the film . favreau is also good , acting as ' the little man ' very well , and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny . graham ( boogie nights , 1997 ) has a small but good role as lorraine , a girl mike finally falls in love with . she hardly features in the film at all , but she still manages to make an impact on the audience . swingers , then , is funny , but it does have some flaws . firstly , the running time is a bit too short . the film comes to an abrupt halt , and i actually wanted the film to carry on longer . it never really comes to a satisfying conclusion , which is a shame , as most films are too long ! also , this type of film has been done too many times , such as sleep with me ( 1994 ) . but these small flaws don ' t really spoil what is a funny , entertaining comedy .", "urban legend surprised me . based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena . thankfully , legend rose above it ' s soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year . you ' re all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who ' s identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody ' s favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the only person you didn ' t suspect ! however , just because legend doesn ' t really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can ' t qualify as first - class entertainment . it was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i ' ve had at the movies all year . the thing is , i ' m not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive . maybe it was the above - par performances by the movie ' s two leads ( jared leto and \" cybil \" actress alicia witt ) . or , it could have been the on - target direction by jamie blanks . more likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise . i don ' t think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman . urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film . a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee - hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill . one problem , though . would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ? i thought not . predictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company . it ' s odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody ' s on the other line . naturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off . and the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! ! a decapitation . it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car . so who is it this time ? the obvious candidate is the slightly off - kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends . a - ha . or could it be the fame - hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ? like all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit . and it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn ' t suspect . i ' m not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due . and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun . * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi , ca", "most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts . my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies . i think he ' s very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years . so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of . unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen ' s humor comes shining through . those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen ' s intelligent observations of life . those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one . in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they ' d never seen before . toy story used state - of - the - art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present . many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture . antz , however , has upped the ante considerably . disney ' s a bug ' s life isn ' t due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal . by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience ' s thirst for computer - animated films . but don ' t let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared . in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios . in 1997 , it was the volcano duel . in my opinion , dante ' s peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality . volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations . in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films . first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it ' s cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact . but now , it ' s even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) . who will prevail ? time will tell , but i ' m sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear . this may sound like i didn ' t like antz ; on the contrary , i ' d put it up there with toy story . but due to it ' s pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn ' t appear in disney ' s version . some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family - oriented film . sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks ' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd . the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended . this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents . antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen ' s shtick and franz kafka ' s metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug . z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker . \" when you ' re the middle child in a family of five million . . . \" he comments about his neglected childhood . one night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life . in walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown . bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction - esque dance while everyone else is following the leader . after discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there ' s a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony . in order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants . but to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her . he and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed . the queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony . meanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him . so z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites . the battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence . however , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence . the second half of the film revolves around z ' s kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia . there , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants . the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass . looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i ' m just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) . the ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground . visually , it ' s an exciting rush of adrenaline . but don ' t be fooled . . . little kids shouldn ' t see this , as they may just try and copy it . after seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again . hopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel . as an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date . visually , it ' s as stunning as what dreams may come . the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren ' t limited by gravity . they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible . one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball . the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball . however , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy ' s shoe . it ' s truly a great example of film making at its finest . with computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants ' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices . the best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) . at one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . . do they ? ) . barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body . young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) . disney ' s a bug ' s life looks good , but i don ' t know if they will be able to best dreamworks ' newest animated feature in terms of animation . if not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) . vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line - ups seen since toy story . in fact , it far exceeds that one . woody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he ' s done in the past few years . without a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing . in fact , i ' m pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines . sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress . sylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star . after a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is . gene hackman is superb as the gruff - talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona . christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns . anne bancroft has a minimal role , but she ' s effective nonetheless . danny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job . dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro - trash bees -- both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd . jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won ' t recognize her voice either . many people will recognize grant shaud ' s voice as the foreman . he played miles on the tv show murphy brown . this is definitely a huge cast with some high - profile names , and it will definitely help it ' s grosses . of course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $ 60 million budget went to , also . directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) . but both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture . tense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals . the screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults . kids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor . most of it will go over young children ' s heads . does that mean you shouldn ' t take kids to see it ? not at all . they will have a lot of fun watching this one . what is great is the themes that are given to us . part social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community . thankfully , it ' s not subtle in either aspects . antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action . sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home . the battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death . and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight . but other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it ' s a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters . i doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it ' s still advisable to leave really young children at home . have i confused you enough ? if you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you ' ll enjoy it the most .", "when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . the first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . decades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot - em - up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . yes , most of the kung fu and other \" martial arts \" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . but , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . the best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . made in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee ' s skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . it succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri - annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun - running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o ' harra , han ' s brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee ' s sister years ago . the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . the main hero was faced against a power - hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . on the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super - tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . in the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti - violent philosophy . the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee ' s acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . it is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . other actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . in many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . i ' m not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can ' t avoid to appreciate the difference from today ' s movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . so , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don ' t like that particular genre .", "not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie . earlier this year , nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year ' s least likeable \" comedies \" called hanging up , featuring a bunch of annoying women ( ironically , lisa kudrow played one in that film as well ) who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves . ick . . . real sweet stuff . but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer , with a film entitled battlefield earth . i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film , even if it was on a \" cheese \" factor , as everybody , and i mean everybody else , pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time . yipes . . . another beauty . so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co - starring the ever - versatile lisa kudrow ? uhhhm , you guessed it . . . not much . plot : in order to escape major financial difficulties , a local weatherman hooks up with his ball - picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery . but as more and more people find out about their scheme , more and more people demand a part of their winnings , and more and more problems arise . critique : simply stated , i didn ' t laugh once during this entire picture . for a comedy , it offered me a few smiles , a bunch of nincompoops as characters , a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow , in what can only described as a \" sluttier \" version of her character of phoebe on tv ' s \" friends \" . this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be , but it was pretty close . thankfully , the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits , dancing as the weatherman were left in the film ' s trailer , and not in this final cut . and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far , beautiful , this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic , idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast . foremost was travolta ' s character , who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie . and for me , the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong . he didn ' t fit the part . i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role . a cool , calculating roughneck with a certain hip , suave \" je ne sais quoi \" . in this film , he looks like he ' s trying to be funny , trying to be bad , trying to be good . we ' re not supposed to be able to notice that , and when we do , at least in my case , i consider it a wrong choice in casting . add that to lisa kudrow , boring us with yet another one of her patented \" dumb blonde \" routines , but this time , dressed in sexier outfits . michael rapaport , stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn ' t quite up at the same speed level as everyone else . and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells , and you ' ve got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize . the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half - interesting and never really bored me . i also liked michael moore ' s perverted cousin character , and i loved , and i say it again , loved the character that bill pullman played . give this dude his own movie ! he played a lazy cop , a man who tries everything not to do any real work . he fakes injuries to get off duty , tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won ' t have to fill out any forms . . . now there ' s a base of humor . sadly , the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film . and there ' s not much else i can say about this movie , folks . on the whole , it was lame , included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines , and very little of interest for any target audience . but get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and i ' m there !", "this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be \" one of the hottest writers in hollywood \" . he wrote the groundbreaking screenplay for scream ( 8 / 10 ) , then added the successful i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5 / 10 ) script to his mix , and also created the popular tv series \" dawson ' s creek \" . so when he asked to direct his first movie , based on his first ever script written , everyone and their grandma said \" sure , go for it ! \" . uhhm , my question is . . . did anyone bother reading this stupid script ? ? ? plot : ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west , mrs . tingle , and set to lose her scholarship to college . when she and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the story , they end up tying her up , and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman . critique : it ' s not so much that this is a bad movie , than the fact that it sucks . this movie is chock - full of one - dimensional characters , contains no actual humor that i was able to zone in on , zero tension or thrills , plot holes the size of my big ass , lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie , and molly ringwald , vivica a . fox and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles . i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery ( 8 / 10 ) and 9 to 5 , but unfortunately for williamson , he went nowhere with the bright foundation , making references to the exorcist and dr . zhivago , which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate . he also forgot about suspense , with all of his characters based on incomprehensible decisions , unbelievable motivations and simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue . sure , katie holmes is cute , and her co - star , marisa coughlan , did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist ( worth two points out of my three on ten ) , but how can we forgive the biggest one - dimensional character in any film , holmes ' rival in the film , mrs . tingle ' s complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others around her ( are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays ? ) and a transparent romance between holmes and some long - haired dude , hired to be the poor man ' s version of skeet ulrich ( who himself is a poor man ' s version of johnny depp ! ) . all in all , this movie was laughable for me , provided me with no insight into anything , demonstrated williamson ' s genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile script , and provided helen mirren with a great role to chew into , unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability , humanity or capacity to comprehend . no hip lines , no cheap thrills , just a dull time at the movie theater . if you want to see a funny teenage movie , go see detroit rock city ( 8 / 10 ) , and thank my drunken , sorry ass in the morning . little known facts about this film and its stars : kevin williamson ' s father was a fisherman . kevin used his knowledge of fishing hooks and winches when creating the killer in i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5 / 10 ) . he is also a huge fan of steven spielberg and coincidentally , so is dawson leery on tv ' s \" dawson ' s creek \" , a show kevin created . he was once an aspiring actor . in fact , he even landed a bit part on tv ' s \" another world \" . also , williamson has gone on record to say that an unsupportive english teacher who once told him that he would never amount to anything was the inspiration for mrs . tingle , which is also loosely based on the book \" killing mr . griffin \" by the writer of i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5 / 10 ) , lois duncan . he has also come out and said that he is a gay man . helen mirren was born in london , england under the name ilynea lydia mironoff . she is married to director taylor hackford , whose works include devil ' s advocate ( 8 / 10 ) and an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5 / 10 ) . this film was originally titled killing mrs . tingle , but was changed after the columbine high school shooting incident . actress marisa coughlan will star in kevin williamson next tv project called \" wasteland \" . this is actor barry watson first full feature film . he has played the character of \" seth \" on tv ' s \" malibu shores \" several times .", "jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive - compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you - know - where . he ' s mean . i mean really mean . the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium . every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress . you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe . one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks . at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too . another person who often crosses melvin ' s sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin ' s floor . aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target . simon ' s friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better . when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon ' s dog while he convalesces . this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage . an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin ' s softening up to the world around him . it doesn ' t happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love . one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others . he ' s traveling terra incognita here , and it shows . good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt . they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen . greg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon . he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels . cuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped - up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance . the screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny . the best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting . melvin is a man we can ' t quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention . carol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem . simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society . combined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film . the one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half . his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved . i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film ' s conclusion . there ' s one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie ' s best scenes and who deserves mention . this is that little dog . he plays such a pivotal role to melvin ' s character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene - stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal . award or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you ' ve got an outstanding movie .", "in this re -

) . harrison ford ' s idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin , which we won ' t mention further ; and has stallone ever really played a villain at all ? this is not to say that porter is a villain , per se . while he isn ' t the sort of character you wouldn ' t want to get on the wrong side of , he ' s nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right - hand men just to prove how mean they are . porter is only trying to get back what is not - so - rightfully his , which in a way is almost understandable . payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy - thriller which won ' t be remembered as being among gibson ' s most important work , but is still one of the finer films he ' s done . the only real problem with it is that , while everything seems to work out in the end , i was left feeling something was lacking ; was that all ? the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute , and the final voice - over doesn ' t ring true , even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film - noir style the rest of the film embodies . the film just ends far too suddenly , after a huge build - up in the penultimate scenes . a fine film , even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation . just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending .", "working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front - line african american actress like jada pinkett smith . despite being one of the freshest talents available , pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame , the nutty professor ) . the problem is , of course , that there aren ' t many good roles available for black women . take away the likes of waiting to exhale , set it off , soul food , and eve ' s bayou , and all that ' s left is a chance to be someone ' s girlfriend , a local whore , or a murder victim . as a result , for pinkett smith ' s first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo . actually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v . s . mayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is . the film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on - screen relationship between pinkett smith ' s woo and tommy davidson ' s tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren ' t forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags . unfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple - digit i . q . the situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit - coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of \" free lobotomy \" lab experiment . woo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places . her latest relationship , with a testosterone - overdosed drug - dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper . now , her transvestite / medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she ' s about to meet mr . right , and that he ' ll be a virgo . later that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo . it ' s not love at first sight , however . things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a \" quiet \" dinner . in the one - hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad \" white \" movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it ' s only fair that we get a \" black \" effort of the same low caliber . as in all romantic comedies , we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together . the question is , are their courtship rituals entertaining ? in a good entry to the genre , the audience becomes caught up in the love story , no matter how familiar it is . in woo , the constant reliance upon unfunny , moronic humor sinks the project . for those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes , there ' s a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) . sadly , that ' s one of the film ' s most enjoyable sequences , and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional . despite exuding charm from every pore , there ' s little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c . johnson ' s script . since it misses the mark by so much , a better name for woo might have been whoops .", "clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976 ' s murder by death . this big screen version of the classic board game ( what ' s next . . . chutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue . the plot , for what it ' s worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr . boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who ' s been blackmailing them all . when he turns up dead , everyone ( including the audience ) must figure out whodunnit . . . and in what room , and with what object . while not as witty as neil simon ' s murder by death , clue definitely has it moments . it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i ' m joking around with my friends . to this day , whenever someone says the phrase \" well , to make a long story short \" i have the follow up phrase \" too late \" ready to go . the cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs . white ) sometimes steals the film away from the rest . and colleen camp , as the french maid yvette , displays some of her natural talents as well . clue is available on dvd from paramount home video . it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer . a french language audio track is also available . the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not , and it even includes a scene not in the film itself ( a scene that should have been in the film , as it ' s a good joke ) . also , the trailer is scored to the music from airplane ! , which was an interesting choice . when clue played in theaters , it ran with the gimmick of three different endings . if you wanted to see all three , you had to go to the movies three separate times . so when the film was released on home video , rather than releasing three separate videos , all three endings were included on one tape . . . the first two endings being \" what if ? \" endings and the third ending being the actual ending . now for the dvd release you get two choices . you can watch the film as it was presented on home video or you can select to watch it with one of the three endings randomly chosen for you . ( note : there ' s an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this . after watching the film with a randomly selected ending , when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it . when you do , a secret menu opens , allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves . ) now while i applaud the effort of paramount here , as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc , it just doesn ' t work well . first , why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch ? maybe someone like myself who ' s seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only . i ' m no technical dvd expert , but i can ' t imagine that being too hard to accomplish . secondly , the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious , thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely don ' t need a distraction . finally , the back of the dvd case states \" and now , with this special dvd version , you can see all 3 surprise endings \" . i have no idea why they would word it that way , since that ' s not a special feature in the slightest . the video has been out for fifteen years now ( good lord , has it been that long ? ) and it ' s played on television with all three endings all the time . these are merely minor complaints however , seeing that i ' ve watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd . the picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy , and i ' m thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format .

( term used as loosely as possible ) survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds . even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger . mind you , i ' ve never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not . some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that ! two fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second . solution ? boom ! i ' ll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much . another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome : our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her . he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers . he still has his shotgun , bring it along you say ? no thanks , i ' ll just ditch it in the back of my car . and the real kicker is this : when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised ! while we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ? i ' ve got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door . ask mr . wild bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life . this is the major problem with this movie , any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better . is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters ? for instance : our heroes hide at duchovny ' s summer home , now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment . ok , this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time . but see , our hero is a drug addict and guess what ? he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt . oh sure , he ' ll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling . going clean is really honorable of him , but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun . for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton , plot holes the size of godzilla , getting our intelligence insulted and several \" oh come on ! \" moments .", "synopsis : wealthy cuban landowner luis ( banderas ) gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride . not only does his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia ( jolie ) , she also harbours a secret past of dubious merit . soon , julia has absconded with both luis ' fortune and his heart , and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld , luis begins to realise that , for him , there is no turning back . review : given the absurdism of its would -

lit and mostly filmed from above , it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show . cristofer doesn ' t even manage to capture the allure of cuba ; instead of portraying his setting as a steamy , sensuous island paradise , it appears bland and lifeless . at least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest ; there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script , but aren ' t being given the chance . the same cannot be said of jane , whose billy is nebbish and transparent . also unwise is the jolie framing sequence , which practically gives away the film ' s denouement .", "wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal . the setting of the film is a town named blue bay . it consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town ' s different benefactors . the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town ' s ritzy , expensive high school . it is here that we meet all of the core characters . there ' s guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan . we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly . throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape . shortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well . this pushes kelly ' s sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted . during the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her . however , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor . after sam is cleared , kelly ' s mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her . it is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together . it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda . matt dillon stars as sam lombardo . sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage . he isn ' t the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance . however , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place . neve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller . suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film . campbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch . playing kelly van ryan is denise richards . kelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra . one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother . denise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film . in the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well . kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette . this character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film . however , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story . still , the film doesn ' t seem to gain much from bacon ' s performance , only his name . in the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan , daphne rubin - vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez , and bill murray shines as sam ' s lawyer , ken bowden . hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film . although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller , the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters . this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it ' s share of twists .", "in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see . i realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike . but in the case of american beauty , i must make an exception . if you haven ' t yet seen it , go see it . now . stop reading this review and head for your local multiplex , then after you ' ve seen it , come back . i ' ll wait here . welcome back . if you followed my advice ( and i see no reason why you should not have , do you ? ) , i ' m sure you ' ve just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life . american beauty is an extraordinary film , a powerful , jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream . it ' s humorous but it isn ' t funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production . mixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended , and by god , it works , making it one of the year ' s very best . lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) has entered the mother of all mid - life crises . he is living life without a purpose . he is bored , depressed and sick of his sheltered , insignificant existence . he barely ever talks to his family , has no sex life , is stuck at a dead - end job and thinks he has no reason to live . but one day , when he and his equally troubled wife ( annette bening ) attend one of his daughter ' s ( thora birch ) cheerleading performances , he sees something that makes him come alive . what he sees is the performance by his daughter ' s friend , the head cheerleader . he develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl ; an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature . but for the first time , lester feels that he is actually living . this crush is only the beginning . lester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life , buying the car of his dreams , cursing off the boss and quitting his job ( \" today i quit my job , told the boss to f * * * himself and blackmailed him for $ 60 , 000 -- would you pass the asparagus please ? \" ) , buying drugs from the voyeur - next - door ( ricky fitts , a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be \" beauty \" ) and refusing to be docile in family affairs . his new attitude further alienates his daughter , only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be , and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor . and the burnhams ' s neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramatic momentum . ricky fitts ( wes bentley ) serves as the film ' s thematic center , providing the obscure , powerful meaning of the title . colonel fitts , the father , is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie , even considering his limited screentime . kevin spacey has never been better , and this performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel . he never plays his droll character as a freak , rather , he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic self - exploration by his dissatisfaction with life . spacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime . equally astonishing is young thora birch , who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness . at two hours and ten minutes , american beauty didn ' t feel nearly long enough . it ' s a complicated , unforgettable film that , like the ice storm two years ago , dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life . powerfully and cynically , it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream . it claims that this picture - perfect image is just that -- an image , and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it . the dark , deeply ironic ending , though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie , stays with you for weeks after it ' s all over . american beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released ; even more so considering it ' s a masterpiece .", "a costume drama set in the 1500s , england , elizabeth is a lush , romantic , political masterpiece about the upset over the crossing of a protestant queen from a respected catholic one . when the court and country are a whole after the passing of the queens , the royal family , so to speak , are upset that a protestant should be crowened , and not another catholic , plus , the new queen , elizabeth i ( cate blanchette ) , was the bastard baby of the previous queen mary ' s father . the persecution over catholics and protestants isn ' t the only majority in elizabeth . elizabeth i must face the decision to give up personal pleasures , and her lover ( joseph fiennes of shakespeare in love ) , in order to rule , successfully , the country , which she did for 40 more years . both elizabeth and shakespeare in love are set in the elizabethian era , and both feature a queen elizabeth i ( judi dench plays her in love ) , or course . yet , i found elizabeth more stimulating and involving than love , not just because elizabeth features a great deal more of elizabeth i , but because i found blanchette a more powerful , hypnotic sense for the role . elizabeth , also featuring geoffrey rush and richard attenborough , is my pick for the best picture of 1998 award . it ' s a dynamic , important , breathtaking film of loyalty , power , greed , and trust . shakespeare would die for the book rights .", "first and foremost i think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the pg rating it ' s been given . for those of us who haven ' t read the james lee burke novel that heaven ' s prisoners is based on , do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts , feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps , gangsters with louisiana accents , plots , sub - plots , more plots , and well , really just want to see teri hatcher naked , this is one movie you ' re going to worry the price of admission over . hopeful still ? well , let me share my moment of sheer panic , and then the cold enervation of the big let - down when a semi - robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin , \" what do you think of my butterfly ? \" . butterfly ? , i asked myself , what butterfly ? ! and then it hit me . . . the scene had been snipped ! damn you , godless pg rating , show us her butterfly ! ! we want to see the goddamn butterfly ! ! ! so . . . no naked teri hatcher . forget about that . okay ? now . . . heaven ' s prisoners is about ex - alchoholic ex - cop dave robicheaux ( alec baldwin ) who ' s trying to discover life anew running a bait shop and boat hire business with his loving , down - to - earth wife annie ( kelly lynch ) . everything dull , but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while they ' re on their boat . the plane nosedives into the water and sinks , but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a little pixie - faced salvadoran girl whom he and his wife immediately decide to adopt . what they don ' t realise is that the plane ' s pilot was also a drug dealer , and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter ' s erstwhile colleagues . when robicheaux discovers this , he predictably , against the advice of his wife , a well - meaning dea agent , and two gangsters who rough him up , begins ' poking his nose where it don ' t belong ' , we know that the man deserves all the misery he ' s going to get . the question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious , meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide . as dave robicheaux , alec baldwin is fat . . . no seriously , this is not the svelte , thinking man ' s hero of the hunt for red october , it is an out - of - shape guy who doesn ' t look too good in a roof - top chasing scene . he ' s also unconvincing in the movie ' s dramatic moments , acting with what as far as i can tell is a steven segal - like economy of expression . three - quarters of the way through the show , while you ' re probably waiting for the next scene in a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle , getting drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up , you ' ll want to beat on him a little yourself . on the other hand , mary stuart masterson ( some kind of wonderful , fried green tomatoes , benny & joon ) cast as a down - and - out stripper who has her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air , with just the right mix of cynicism , warmth , insecurity and humour to be the movie ' s only endearing character . eric roberts as bubba rocque , always believable as the woman - abusing bad guy who knows how to box ( see final analysis , coincidentally also directed by phil joanou ) is believable here as the woman - abusing bad guy who knows how to box . and lest we forget teri hatcher ' s role in all this , this being her rather well - publicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tv ' s \" adventures of lois & clark \" . . . she is totally ridiculous as rocque ' s manipulative and seductive cajun wife , coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who ' s trying to get back at an employer who hasn ' t been giving her enough days off . it ' s probably safe to say that her day job beckons . and at the end of our day , none of this is really worth 2 hrs and 12 minutes of our personal misery . the flying inkpot ' s rating system : * wait for the video . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice .", "i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie . using their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super - famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . now , before i continue to ferociously attack what ' s wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . catherine zeta - jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) . if you ' ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don ' t have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes . the problem we come to is that we ' ve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn ' t break any new ground in the big - budget / hollywood / action genre . the result is that the entire production feels contrived . i ' m going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run - time was looking at catherine zeta - jones . now while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta - jones , it certainly isn ' t for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are . just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between \" entrapment \" and \" blackmail \" . with an eighty million dollar budget , you ' d think that entrapment would at least feature edge - of - your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f / x . well , you ' d be wrong . the action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular . unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years . the reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what ' s going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists . many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta - jones in extremely tight - fitting clothing . one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser - beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . nothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn ' t she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? i ' ll tell you why : because it ' s a great excuse to photograph zeta - jones ' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta - jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . one last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he ' ll spontaneously disappear in ninja - like fashion . i can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself \" it ' ll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? \" we know jon , it ' s called editing .", "beware of movies with the director ' s name in the title . take \" john carpenter ' s ghosts of mars \" ( please ) . if the carpenter brand name wasn ' t superglued to the title , this embarrassment would surely have bypassed theaters entirely and gone straight to its proper home on the usa network . and i would have been spared a headache . the latest from the director of \" starman , \" \" halloween \" and \" escape from new york \" is a lousy western all gussied up to look like a futuristic horror flick . the production is set on mars in 2176 , where humanity looks for relief from the overpopulation strangling their home world . six hundred and forty thousand people in a matriarchal society live and work at outposts all over the red planet , terra - forming to make it more hospitable for future generations . a matriarchal society . terra - forming . sounds pretty intriguing , eh ? well , don ' t get your hopes up .", "bill condon ' s \" gods and monsters \" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics \" frankenstein \" and \" bride of frankenstein . \" since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale ' s inner fantasies and hallucinations . whale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him . as the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home . james whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , \" a dirty old man . \" in one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale ' s home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing . because of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off . clayon agrees , and doesn ' t really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past . certainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis . \" gods and monsters \" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a \" motion picture director , \" rather than a \" horror director . \" and in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore . it is evident that whale ' s first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life . as played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself . he never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person . through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life . although boone is only in a dead - end job as a gardener of people ' s homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good - looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him . since whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor . although an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness . it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the \" on - again - off - again \" friendship at the film ' s center is fairly predictable . we know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds . in lesser hands , this set - up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this . also , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again . if the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether . \" gods and monsters \" is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone . the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end . walking away from \" gods and monsters , \" it was ian mckellen ' s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably . it is a sad testament when a person ' s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else ' s business in the first place .", "\" living out loud , \" is the type of motion picture we don ' t often see : it is a film about mature , intelligent adults , instead of the usual american film , in which children basically dress up in grown - up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven - year - olds . judith ( holly hunter ) , a fortysomething living in new york city , has been having a difficult time with life lately . she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband ( martin donovan ) , who had been cheating on her . she cannot sleep , haunted by terrible memories , often imagines off - the - wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place , and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers , liz bailey ( queen latifah ) , perform at a local club . judith ' s life does start to brighten a little when , one night when she gets home to her apartment late , strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator , pat ( danny devito ) , a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently . both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other , seeking comfort with the other person , but while pat starts to form a deep love for her , judith only wants to remain friends . \" living out loud , \" which was written by richard lagravenese ( \" the bridges of madison county \" ) , who is also making his directing debut here , is a wonderful film from beginning to end , one that is honest , genuinely funny , and poignant . the three central characters , that of judith , pat , and liz , are all written to be free - thinking , complex human beings , and are all likable , but flawed , people who are constantly interesting , as is the film itself . one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen . sometimes it results in comedy , and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching . one sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself , reading a novel . an older woman comes over to her , mentions that that is a great book she is reading , and then goes over to join her own friends . as the woman sits down , she looks over to see judith by herself , and motions for her to come join them . instantly , we realize this was simply in judith ' s mind , as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends . holly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here . hunter , of course , was brilliant in 1993 ' s \" the piano , \" for which she won an academy award , but in this film she is even better , i think . she finds the right note for each scene and holds it . and devito has never had such a humanistic role before , which i was surprised about . usually he is used as the butt of a joke , or as a caricature , but in this film , has a living - and - breathing , sympathetic person to play . topping it all off is latifah , also a singer , who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself , and has a juicy , natural supporting role as , in some ways , judith ' s role model . another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived , \" happy \" ending , but , in staying with its realistic tone , manages to be upbeat , but truthful . the last shot is an especially powerful image . nothing is said , but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all . the relationship that results between judith and pat is true - to - life and sincere . as we watch these two people talk , and get to know each other , all that we wish for them both is to be happy , even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved . and as , \" living out loud , \" which is one of the best films of the year , proves , sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for .", "jean -

matinee showing of it , and i thought it was worth every penny . the characterizations are mostly flat , one dimesional , but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters . rob cohen ( dragonheart ) does a great job with this film .", "tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it ' s evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . tectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non - traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . it ' s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all - but - screaming , \" look ! art ! \" ) , although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . because we ' re constantly made aware that we ' re watching a play or a movie , it ' s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer ' s ideas . they ' re not real , sympathetic , or believable . i ' m willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . one day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . while preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re - think her decision . meanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross - dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter - culture talkshow host . with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf / mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . however , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . the tone is soporific , the supposedly - intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn ' t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one - hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . there are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren ' t bilingual ) . the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it ' s different , ( b ) it ' s not like anything they ' ve seen before , and ( c ) it ' s pretentious . for everyone else , it ' s not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage .", "\" mission to mars \" is one of those annoying movies where , in the middle of the movie , you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie : all five minutes of it . \" mission \" * does * give you payoff ; but when it does come , it ' s too little , too late . \" mission \" has some good ideas , but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery , dime - a - dozen dialogue , and spate of good actors wasted in cardboard - cutout roles . i ' m sure the director and writers were very proud of each hallmark moment they came up with , so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm . glances don ' t communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end . the film spends an hour on this kind of stuff , building to its climax . a lot of it is a cliched glorification of family relationships , marriage , friendship , unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap . there are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film , and i give it points for trying to stay true to the science i know ( trying is the key word here ) . the sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching , but as mentioned by then we ' re so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie to be over . great design , good intentions , but no cigar . if you ' re not a die hard sci - fi , fx or jerry o ' connell fan ( his character is the only one who has some semblance of character ) , don ' t waste your eight bucks on this . and what the hell , tim robbins died halfway through the movie , in a stupid way too . that ' s just unforgiveable .", "where do i begin ? okay , how about with this : starship troopers is one of the worst movies to hit theaters in a long time . in fact , it might even be the worst * major * release film to come out in years . . . or even a decade . this is bad beyond belief . i would * not * suggest paying money to see this . there ' s a good chance you ' ll regret it . if you see it for free , you could still want to walk out . go right ahead . the movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world of . . . buenos aires . here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors and actresses playing obnoxious , easy - to - * despise * - with - a - passion characters that have love triangles , love rectangles , and love hexagons screwing up their life . before long they all go off and join the military , primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined . they train . they strut around nude for no reason whatsoever . after an hour of making the audience scream in agony , they start fighting bugs . the big bugs look nice , even though their design is only \" okay . \" unfortunately , the fights are boring since we * want * all of the characters dead anyway . cue more agony . then some characters have sex . then some more die . * * * who cares ? ? ? * * * cue more agony . the movie ends , the audience runs out to their cars , vomits over the pavement , and attempts to drive home . unfortunately , after that torture , they can ' t think straight , don ' t pay attention to the road , and many are in ugly car wrecks . you remember how batman & robin was bad ? well , batman & robin kicked this movie ' s sorry butt , people . starship troopers does not succeed as an action movie . it does not succeed as a drama . it does not succeed as a war movie . it does not succeed as a comedy . it does not succeed as a satire . it does not succeed as a parody . it succeeds as being horrible . terrible . gut - wrenchingly bad . i wanted to run away from that movie every minute . but i paid my money and i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better . so i stayed . it never got better . frequently , it did the impossible , and got * worse * . the movie as written , acted , directed , and basically just feels as a whole like it ' s about on the mental maturity level of a free willy 4 . the whole thing feels like a movie that only three - year - olds could enjoy . . . except for the ridiculously gratuitous blood and gore , and pointless nudity . it ' s written for little children , but children should definitely * not * go anywhere near it . of course , i recommend the same for everyone . don ' t go anywhere near it . verhoeven ' s got a streak going now . his last movie was showgirls . he seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can get before people finally stop coming . showgirls was a failure , but it appears that , though it ' ll be lucky to make near its budget , this movie will still do okay gross - wise . is it really * all * bad ? well , no . troopers has about four or five lines of dialouge / short humorous scenes that are actually funny , mostly from the \" do you want to know more ? \" commercials that pop up throughout the story , promoting the joys of the joining the troopers . so that adds up to about 30 seconds of entertainment and still about one hour , 59 minutes , and 30 seconds of miserable torture . i ' m totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie . but i do admit it . so , if you ' re willing to possibly put yourself through torture , go ahead and see it , and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it . i don ' t know how anyone or any * thing * could love this movie , but hey , to each his own . feel free to give it a shot . of course , in the interest of saving your souls , i don ' t recommend it . but guess what ? alien resurrection comes out november 26th , and , having already seen some of it and having read the script , i assure you that it will blow pretty much everyone away . though opinion on starship troopers is reasonably split , it ' ll be difficult to find someone that * won ' t * like alien resurrection when they ' ve seen it . this is possibly the year ' s best intense action film , or at least * one * of the best . if you really want to see alien warfare that ' s played out intelligently and seriously , see alien resurrection . please , avoid this .", "i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series . if there ' s a will , there ' s a way ; and i believe that anything , no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon . this is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sant ' s universally panned update of psycho ; i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience , but also very on - par with an original . but i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad . you see , the point of a remake is , or at least it should be , to iron out the original ' s flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection . but what if the source material on which the remake is based isn ' t any good to begin with ? that is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad . i ' ve only seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which it is based , and to be honest , i didn ' t like it all that much . it has a concept that -- and still is -- interesting ; a group of corrupt young adults , all in their early 20s are given a choice : they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed , or they can become undercover cops , helping the police get into places that they normally wouldn ' t be able to access . obviously , all 3 opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen ( and policewomen ) . the three main characters here are played by claire danes , omar epps and giovanni ribisi . of the three , only danes has a real character . ribisi ' s dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs ; epps ' slightly more intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes . when the squad ' s superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death , the three of them , sure that their beloved master was framed , go off and investigate on their own , discovering corrupt cops , lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations . all kinds of good stuff ! the only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments . although ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie , his man here is really rather amusing , when the script gives him a chance . epps ' straight man is effectively played against ribisi ' s clueless spontaneity . but the rest of the film is dull , boring and singularly uninteresting . a drug - op action plot is no longer anything new , not even with teenage action heroes , and the way it ' s executed here , it ' s also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful . claire danes ' character has potential , but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained . she could have been a tour - de - force , but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role . epps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected , although their characters aren ' t nearly as rich as danes ' could have been . the mod squad is a mind - numbing marketing plot of a film , and teens will jump all over it . it ' s full of bad dialogue , scenes and concepts that make no sense and -- get this -- drug dealers that like to tango with other guys in their spare time . nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for . claire danes is no longer alluring -- mainly because she ' s got a horrible hairdo , so that draw is out . there are , however , cool explosions , guns and chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of some sort . do not be fooled . some may call this escapist fare -- i call it escape - as - quickly - as - you - can fare .", "the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy . but after diasappointing films such as \" godzilla \" and \" fear and loathing in las vegas \" , it would be nice to see a really good film . but i doubt you could have expected this . the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen , and it deserves a spot on the \" decade ' s best \" list . there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim , \" yes , that ' s what makes this film great . \" the blend of peter weir ' s masterful ( and in many ways brilliant ) direction , peter biziou ' s stunning photography and jim carrey ' s performance is what makes this film work so fantastically . there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show . it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame , but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect . carrey has made a very wise choice . by playing mild - mannered truman burbank , he allows himself enough room to be comical , and therefore not alienating his true fans , while still showing a vulnerable and human side . that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes . truman burbank was born to an audience of millions . he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show . everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians , led by the show ' s director , christof ( played by ed harris ) . everyone in truman ' s life is an actor or an extra . they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe , people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in truman ' s life . but he is the only person that is not aware of it . the classification of the truman show may be tricky . the audience reacted to many of truman ' s revelations with laughter . i did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character . the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes , because what was happening to him , indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong . so is this going to end up labeled as a comedy ? a drama ? it really depends on the audience . but to me , the truman show was a touching , sad tale about the extents to which a corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others . but above all else , the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor , heart and scary realism . oscar predictions in june are pointless , but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of 1997 , as originally planned , james cameron would be oscar - less .", "there ' s good news and bad news about mulan . the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy - handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules . on the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast . but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney ' s best animated feature since the lion king . after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians . mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever - popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married . that ' s what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming - na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her . cartoons . . . meanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns . since mulan ' s a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go . she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family . that ' s chinese culture for you . . . so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father ' s uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place . the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army . it should have been called g . i . chang . mulan calls on her ancestors for help . they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up . voiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges . murphy ' s performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad - libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they ' re going to have . you ain ' t never had a friend like mushu . speaking of songs , mulan doesn ' t have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this . disney songs about war probably wouldn ' t go over too well ( \" heigh ho , heigh ho , it ' s off to war i go . . . \" ) , and the ones they do have aren ' t memorable . the best of the bunch , sad to say , is \" be a man , \" the requisite basic training montage song . yes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle . sung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , \" be a man \" accompanies footage of mulan ' s platoon going from screw - ups to heroes . it makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that ' s ended badly ? i only wish real - life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage . for the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl . all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder - length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china . the deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12 - year - old boy , at best . but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil - eyed attilla - looking monster . as a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable . i saw the movie yesterday and i don ' t remember the man ' s name . otherwise , mulan is a good movie . the animation of the characters themselves isn ' t as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots . eddie murphy pulls off some good one - liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star . hell , george \" mr . sulu \" takei does a voice in mulan . you get the sense disney said to themselves , \" alright , let ' s get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood . who can you think of ? \" \" well , there ' s mr . myagi . . . \" \" good . \" \" and mr . sulu . \" \" perfect . we ' ve got ourselves a movie now . \" soon disney really _will_ be able to paint with all the colors of the wind .", "a big house . a big director , jan de bont of speed and twister fame . a big star , catherine zeta - jones , hot of the heels of entrapment ( 6 . 5 / 10 ) and zorro . a big remake of the haunting . and big special effects . so what do they all amount to ? unfortunately for us , a big bore ! plot : a hotshot doctor brings three insomniacs to an old , spooky mansion for controlled testing . unbeknownst to the patients , the good doctor is actually conducting his own cover project that has to do with the psychology of fear . critique : this movie just didn ' t scare me one bit . sure , it creeped and spooked me out a little here and there , but on the whole , it took waaaaay too long to get going , provided very little meat in the plot , went way past its own bedtime , and basically relied on grunts , the muttering of children ' s voices and over - the - top special effects , to scare us . well , this film didn ' t do much for me . and they might as well have called it the \" haunting of lily taylor \" , since she ' s basically the only character who had any real depth , background or reason to be in the house in the first place . don ' t get me wrong , catherine zeta was sweet window dressing ( despite my continued perception of her faint mustache - see entrapment ) , and owen wilson was good as the standard \" comic relief \" , but come on people , if you ' re going to have us sit through two hours in a theater with these folks , how ' bout giving them a little more than one - liners as dimension . neeson was also wasted as the smart , british guy . it ' s all too sad , cause certainly the \" idea \" seemed like a good one ( see the shining ( 9 / 10 ) for a close to perfect example of a creepy gone awry ) , but the story was thin , the conclusion was laughable ( be gone . . . poof ! ) and the special effects ? well , they sure were nice to look at , but not for a moment did one of them scare , or even for a split - second , have me believe that they were anything more than hollywood special gadgetry . see it for zeta - jones , or if you like special effects and scary movies that take forever to get going , and provide very little payback , otherwise skip it and check out the original or the ultimate movie about spooky homes from the netherworld , the shining . little known facts about this film and its stars : goofy actor owen wilson co - scripted indie favorites rushmore ( 8 / 10 ) and bottle rocket with director wes anderson . his brother luke wilson is also an actor , who once dated drew barrymore for a year or so . brother andrew is also an actor . singer lisa loeb is listed in the credits as having portrayed the character of olivia morice , but i personally did not notice her . she is well known for her number one single \" stay ( i missed you ) \" and goofy glasses . the creaks and moans heard throughout the house were prerecorded and played during filming in order to get a more natural expression of fear out of the actors . catherine zeta - jones is currently dating flabby ass actor michael \" sex is my life \" douglas . she stands 5 ' 8 \" . in 1998 , actor michael rapaport pleaded guilty to the aggravated harassment of lily taylor . he was ordered to stay away from her and undergo counseling for one year . actor bruce dern , who plays the throwaway role of the gatekeeper in this film , was once nominated for an oscar for best supporting actor for his role in coming home . director jan de bont was born in holland , and began his lengthy career as a cinematographer on films as die hard , hunt for red october and basic instinct , directed by another dutchman , paul verhoeven . actor todd field also played a small but pivotal role in stanley kubrick ' s last film , eyes wide shut . he was nick nightingale , the pianist . this film was originally titled the haunting of hill house .", "there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason . \" good will hunting \" is about one of those people . the will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let ' s face it , this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co - writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius . he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino . and he works at mit . . . as the janitor . one day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( \" breaking the waves \" ' s stellan skarsg ? rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete . the next day , it ' s already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it . so lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove . and , duh , it ' s done again . of course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will . before lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy . after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , \" afternoon delight \" ) . finally , lambeau ' s old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up . turns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not . it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge . and that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co - writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction . is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ? should this guy be forced to do something he doesn ' t want to do ? this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam - packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should . i ' m not saying \" good will hunting \" is a bad film at all . it ' s a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it . the acting is amazing , with two oscar - nomination - worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together . we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will ' s love interest , skylar . there are tons of individual moments that i adored . i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them . i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends . there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch . and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable . like the break - up scene between will and skylar , will and sean ' s first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn ' t regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter . however , the main flaw of the film is there ' s too much of everything , and not enough of it either . the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they ' re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten . take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father / son as well as doctor / patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face . we hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times . but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do . also , will ' s relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action . we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one . their relationship never goes beyond \" just best friends , \" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human . maybe it was just me . and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten . and , of course , as in most films like this , the girl / boy relationship is pretty underwritten . we never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it ' s there for plot details that anything else . minnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character . the writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness . sure , it feels overstuffed , but it ' s extremely enjoyable . the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human . i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing . while this is probably director gus van sant ' s most conservative film ( you ' d hardly know it ' s the same director of \" to die for , \" the only van sant film i ' ve seen , really ) , it ' s still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what ' s this \" best picture \" deal ? ) . and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws , i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone .", "big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america . o . j . simpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers . all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms . and , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood . whether it be john grisham ' s thrilling novels or television ' s famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks . so when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat . however , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one . john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it . no one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever . but , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting . a civil action is not john ' s best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 . travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations . his performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid . if he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average . luckily , he has a strong supporting cast . william h . macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood . he continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor . in a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta ' s paranoid and greedy accountant . he is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film . he is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant . but , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action . robert duvall is also an underrated actor . he gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey . duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co - defendant . duvall is magical in this role . he is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way . in many non - comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes . unfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar - jar binks , anyone ? ) . however , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed . this is not the case in a civil action . they have comedy coming from all sides . whether it be duvall ' s inane questions or macy ' s sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace . granted , it ' s not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides a nice addition to the film . the plot is terrific - somewhat . the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom . then the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) ' s career rears its ugly head . they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it . however , budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt . i will not spoil the rest , although i must speak of the one downside to the film . the courtroom debates are great , but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored . it left me somewhat confused , although the rest of the film is terrific . all in all , john travolta is back yet again in this great film . his supporting cast , consisting of macy and duvall , turn in tremendous performances , which ease the load on travolta . the film is smart , witty and thought provoking . not only does it gauge in - court battles , but also the various tolls it can take on the major players . a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves .", "i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews , and in both instances , he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon . now , i personally remember those films as a ) starring a major motion picture star b ) being funny c ) having great action sequences d ) great chemistry e ) decent character development . hmmm . . . . okay . . . now on to my review of chill factor . plot : a graveyard shift regular working joe and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex - army general , to propose a nuclear device to international prospects . when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps , they must keep it cool on ice , and rush it over to an army base , before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit , and kills millions of people . critique : \" speed on an ice - cream truck \" is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one - tone movie to its backers , but unfortunately , the only way that anyone could compare this film to that tension - filled , original two hours of cinema , is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film , and the lethal weapon movies , stood for . this film is seasoned in cliches , with plenty of badly written dialogue , over the top acting from cuba gooding jr . , zero chemistry between the two leads , and horribly tacky bad guys , tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe . my friend and i enjoyed watching this movie to a certain extent , because some of the lines in it were so bad and obviously \" written \" , that we just had to crack up . that , and the formula for the film ' s script which followed the proverbial 1 - 2 - , and you guessed it . . . 3 scenario ! and what about all those catchy , hip names to get us to relate to the characters . . . . \" elvis \" and \" nighshift \" , oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters ( and yes , it actually took two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel ) . it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich and cuba gooding jr . got involved in this one - week - old - blue - cheese - smelling project . did they actually think that it would boost their careers , or did they know that the script sucked , but discounted any fall from grace , knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall ? most probably the latter . have you seen either fled or bulletproof ? well , despite the slight differences in plot , the essentials are basically the same here . you get a black guy and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people , having no choice but to work together to get somewhere , hating each other at first , but over time , learning to respect one another as individuals . yawn . add to that , the fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in black , drive black cars and black vans , and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head . not too conspicuous , eh ? call me a party - pooper , but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy , this film just doesn ' t even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining . one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside , and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an island , do not a fun , buddy - action flick make . show cuba the money , everybody ! : ) little known facts about this film and its stars : this is not a little known fact or anything , but damn , is it just me or does skeet ulrich look an awful lot like great - looking actor johnny depp ? skeet ' s real - life nicknames include chester , skeeter and mosquito . he stands 6 ' 1 \" , was born in north carolina , and got married in 1997 to that sex - kitten actress from clay pigeons ( 7 . 5 / 10 ) , georgina cates . they own a farm together in virginia and seven dogs . skeet has a long scar on his chest from open - heart surgery done when he was 10 to correct a ventricle defect . actor cuba gooding jr . was born in the bronx , new york . in 1984 , he break - danced during the closing ceremonies of the olympic games in los angeles . he stands 5 ' 10 \" . actress hudson leick , who plays one of the \" bad guys / girls \" in his movie , is better known from her role as \" callisto \" on the popular tv series \" xena : princess warrior \" . this film reportedly had a budget of $ 40 million ? ? i ' m not exactly sure where all this money went , but it certainly did not register onscreen . interestingly enough , director hugh johnson , who makes his big screen debut with this film , was the cinematographer on the 1996 film white squall and the 1997 demi moore vehicle , g . i . jane ( 6 . 5 / 10 ) .", "this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash . this is more about a parable of greed , and how money can become the bane of your life . yes , there are elements of ? fargo ' here ( the snow and cold ) , although not as vivid in the blood and gore department . it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives . and how at the end of the day , the things that matter most are love , truth and honesty . although in one sense it may seem tedious , making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ) , it does become tedious , not because of the morale ending , but because one expects the movie to end that way . this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime , the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there . the characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk , brothers and friends , who all fall prey to the avarice of money . they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible , level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance . commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton , whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful . bill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother , whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife , who indirectly causes the most problems . fill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars , and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath . it ' s not a simple plan , when you shoot everyone you love for money , unless you ' re the menendez brothers .", "one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel . that concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century . however , the big grand - daddy of time travels , h . g . wells ' novel the time machine , wasn ' t written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences . the author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour . whatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages . instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space . the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration . first of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own . the plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time . at the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time . they are skeptical , but that doesn ' t prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future . at first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars . finally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions . when he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines . but , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld . the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times . for h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie . even the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old - fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era . compared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought - provoking films . of course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness . for example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today . some of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing . but , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old - fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture . the acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george ' s trusted friend filby . yvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role . however , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science - fiction films sorely miss these days .", "writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard . harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun . harder than building a bridge over troubled waters . and incidentally , a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review . thrillers are all variations on a theme . you have a smart , resourceful , and powerful bad guy , who has a goal he has to meet . you have a noble and brave good guy , who has to protect the innocent , kill the bad guy , and not get killed himself in the process . the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner . this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest , high noon , or silence of the lambs , or big summer blockbusters like men in black , the fugitive , or air force one , or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds , event horizon , kull the conqueror . . . . is anyone else getting depressed here ? point is , it ' s not enough to follow the formula . you ' ve got to throw in something extra , something good and new and better than the last version . something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals . this is a hard thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary in every way . without that something extra -- whether it ' s a great plot or a well - written screenplay , or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs -- the movie fails . that ' s why the jackal , with all its starpower , with all its budget , with all its hype , gets a big fat f . bruce willis is the bad guy , the jackal , a legendary killer for hire . richard gere is the good guy , a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal . the jackal is trying to kill someone . gere is trying to stop him . will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ? ( i ' ll give you three guesses , and the first two don ' t count . ) there are no surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal , no moment when you say to yourself , \" i wonder what happens next ? \" the script for the jackal isn ' t ripped straight from today ' s headlines . it ' s ripped off , straight from an episode of millennium . throughout the movie , we learn what the jackal ' s plans are and how he intends to accomplish them . no surprise . the fun of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal ' s plan is and developing a clever plan to foil the bad guy . instead , we get two ( count ' em , two ) scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere and instantly divines the jackal ' s plan just as if he ' s frank black ( or more likely , just as if he ' s been handed a copy of the script ) . and we never get more than a superficial clue as to why gere has had this flash of insight . it ' s like gere ' s character is psychic , but neither he nor the fbi ( or the screenwriters ) seem to know it . and just like in millennium , the bad guy has an overwhelming need to go after the people the good guy cares about , whether or not they are important to what he ' s trying to do or not . what ' s more , in the last half of the movie , the jackal , supposedly a super - smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake , comes down with a major case of the stupids . as for the performances . . . bruce willis manages to get through the whole movie without a wisecrack , which is a major achievement , but not enough reason to see the movie . his disguises are good , but not as good or as interesting as val kilmer ' s in the saint . richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent , which detracts from his otherwise lifeless and dull performance . sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie -- not that his performance is bad or anything , it ' s not , but it is sad that hollywood won ' t use this talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent ( shoot to kill , sneakers ) . writing a good plot and a good screenplay , like i said , is hard , but it can be done . it wasn ' t done here . it is our job as consumers to reward good screenplays and to denounce bad and uninteresting ones . do not go see this movie . you ' ll only encourage the producers to make more just like it . instead , stay home and rent day of the jackal , or in the line of fire , or a fire safety video , for crying out loud . anything other than the jackal , which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones of other , better movies .", "while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general . words \" croatia \" and \" croatians \" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations . the rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth ' s bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context . in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers ' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise . same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime . the movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe . his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro . shannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away . after being arrested and tortured by kimba ' s secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) . upon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d ' etat against kimba . shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war . thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary . it shouldn ' t surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books . those plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman ' s the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre . this one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires . unlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work . the movie doesn ' t try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda . christopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role . his performance in this film perhaps isn ' t breathtaking , yet adequate . his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world - weary man whose alienation from the \" normal \" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends . although the movie doesn ' t lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken ' s , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character . however , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o ' neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon ' s reluctant colleague . this was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director . with the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess . luckily , the dogs of war had a good script . irvin ' s direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel . the only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places . in the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes . unfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn ' t help . but , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama .", "supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt after a pair of lions start killing off the workers in 1898 . john patterson ( val kilmer ) , the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation , tried to rid his operation of the lions , but fails . a world renound hunter , remington ( michael douglas ) , is called in and the battle , man against lion , begins . this film has a great soundtrack , and wonderful scenery . the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin . we only see one side of each character . kilmer is a bridge builder and that ' s all we see him as . these lions kill dozens of his men and he doesn ' t even appear to be too upset about it . and the plot ? it ' s jaws , but with lions . again we ' re presented with an animal that behaves not at all as it should . it appears to kill men because it just likes too . why ? who knows . i guess there wouldn ' t be much of a story if it didn ' t . the problem is that there isn ' t much of a story even though it does .", "plot : during a 10 - week span in london in the fall of 1888 , jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never uncovered , committed five ritualistic , grisly murders of prostitutes . this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century - old mystery . critique : awesome ! i love dark movies , i love stylish movies , i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp . . . so yes , i really dug this movie ! the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance , out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously , and this movie , my friends . . . is very serious ! in fact , it ' s also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell . it ain ' t for the kids , i ' ll tell you that much . and if any of those recent hack directors of two - bit scream - esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective \" kill scenes \" , do not look any further , because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner , especially when compared to their generic slice - and - dice contrivances . in fact , most of this film ' s structure is very creative , the actors , all solid , the atmosphere and \" feel \" of the picture , remarkably real ( gotta love those \" unfortunates \" ) , and the descent into darkness , well honed by the filmmakers . you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time . but it ' s also an impressive mystery film , based on the true - life tale of jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never discovered . the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel \" from hell \" written by alan moore and presents a compelling story , which despite being a little oliver stone - ish , did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely , and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem , sexual depravity , drug usage , insanity , murders and love ? yes , the brothers even managed to slip a little \" love \" story in here , and despite not truly being developed , i guess it could ' ve been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already . that ' s right , there ' s no real need to put any \" romance \" in a film about a mass murderer ! but that aside , you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp , who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities , to center this movie all the way through . sure , he ' s just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow , but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one . i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film ( i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie , but she was fine ) and how little the dreams / fantasies of depp ' s character had to do with the film ' s development ( from what i had seen in the trailer , i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story , but thankfully , it wasn ' t ) . on the downside , the film doesn ' t really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development . but then again , a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all - time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement . i mean , the less i knew about each person , the more suspicious i became of each one ' s motives , reasons , etc . . . in fact , i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end , and that was in part , due to the distance to which i ' d been held from the film ' s characters . . . or am i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention ? perhaps . overall , this is an extremely creepy production , with glorious cinematography ( reminiscent of coppola ' s dracula and burton ' s sleepy hollow ) , a grim score and solid acting . but it ' s not for everyone . some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events , and even though the murders aren ' t shown as graphically as you might think , there ' s enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors . but i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable , gothic atmosphere , and this flick is just that and plenty more ! and god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the ripper ' s haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon . . . brrrrr ! where ' s joblo coming from ? the crow ( 9 / 10 ) -

year old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god . a satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side , while the girl ' s aunt wants to . . . well , save her from those damn devil worshippers ! enter one occult expert agent , plenty of bobo cops and lots of nuns praying , and you ' ve just about got the gist of things here . critique : with plot holes the size of my ass , this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich ? - ridden plot , with wasted talent , cheezy effects , bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot . what ' s good about this movie ? well , rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway children ' s shelter / satanist supreme , with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around . the little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesn ' t really do all that much . and believe it or not , i was actually enjoying some of the film ' s first half hour , which starts off with some promise , but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist , basinger , just drown the film ' s entire basis of believability . for some reason , it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted , and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes . . . is a dumb one ! add that to the entire police force of incompetents , save for jimmy smits ( whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good career move ? at least change the clothes , jimmy ! ) , zero scares , zero thrills and even less actual drama , and you ' ve got yourself a pretty bad movie . and why would respected actors like christina ricci and ian holm take bit parts in this movie ? did they owe the director a favor or something ? together , they barely have five minutes of screen time , but i suppose that ricci ' s hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horn - dogs . the worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending , which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of \" sneaking up \" on a man ' s house , who they know to be guilty of a crime ! uuuhmm . . . how ' s about knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass , officers ? ! anyway , i don ' t usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof ( and there was plenty to go around ) . and did basinger lose some of her acting \" talent \" during her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win ? difficult to say if it was her lines that were really bad , or if she just delivered them poorly . either way , little originality , very obvious computer effects , little thrills , little drama and very little entertainment value , certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film . but if you really don ' t mind a rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic and \" kid \" - based thrillers , and enjoy watching films that don ' t bring anything new to the table . . . well , drink some beers , smoke some beans and rent this video , because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year .", "vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico . the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out . while the initial imagery is a little over - dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence . that is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line . but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene . then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that . the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end . and that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire $ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery . this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it . what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires . there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore . anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans . this has not always been carpenter ' s style . his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film ' s central science fictional question . jack crow heads a vampire swat team , cleaning up nests of vampires with high - tech spears and crossbows . in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is . now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) . to make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust . meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico . if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that ' s exactly what it is . the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin . but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people , don ' t tell them . just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown . fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding , why are the vampires in new mexico -- what do they want and why do they want it , what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church , how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it ? the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but instead are revealed through dialog . now if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses the james wood persona . woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well . but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio - leone - style mythic posturing . while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target . woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero . that is not his style and it just does not work very well . there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses . in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor . one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair . as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down . one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret . these vampires do not maintain a low profile . there are arguably logical flaws in the film . there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires . it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight . i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out . while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the - 4 to + 4 scale . perhaps i will read the book .", "i can hear the question already . what on earth do these two movies have in common ? to most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors . as i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers . but oh , how differently the packages affect their films . while \" everyone ' s \" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion ' s imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones ' script is . i left \" everyone says i love you \" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face . i left \" the portrait of a lady \" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less . \" everyone \" features nothing allen hasn ' t done before storywise . woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong -- again . similar situations happen to his family and friends . some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his \" early , funny \" films . the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of \" take the money and run , \" his directorial debut . however , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one - of - a - kind display of sheer good spirits . in fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what ' s most important . yes , the movie would have been better -- among his very best , i think -- if it had a meatier story . but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling . and what better way to express feeling than through music ? love is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart . some are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there . it also helps that as usual , allen has a top - flight cast working with him . their singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) . but while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience . granted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders . jane campion , too , has a top - flight cast working for her in \" portrait of a lady , \" too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one . campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye - filling images that linger in the mind . unfortunately , what didn ' t linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting . i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people . even worse , i don ' t find myself feeling bad that i ' ve forgotten . the problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material . it was the script that couldn ' t convince me to care about anyone . the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them . i understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives . jones ' script never simply gave me that opportunity . in the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes . unfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film . in the end , the movie ' s one strength ended up hurting it . so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them . why ? with both films , my head cared about neither story , but only \" everyone says i love you \" was able to make my heart sing .", "good films are hard to find these days . great films are beyond rare . proof of life , russell crowe ' s one - two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems . a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true . consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe ' s character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan ' s character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world . i haven ' t seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah ' s masterpiece , the getaway . but enough with the gossip , let ' s get to the review . the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti - government soldiers . upon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $ 6 million . the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money . with no choice available to her , bowman ' s wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband . but when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands . the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character - driven vehicle filled with well - written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors . the script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap / ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil ' s advocate and dolores claiborne . the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso . dug out from b - movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe ' s right hand gun while providing most of the film ' s humor . ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne . the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes . the bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story ' s characters . the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise . director taylor hackford mixes both his old - school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film . proof of life is a thinking man ' s action movie . it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night .", "\" crazy / beautiful \" suffers from the damned - if - you - do , damned - if - you - don ' t syndrome . after a spate of flighty , cookie - cutter teen films , the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story . but rather than applaud the production , early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown \" afterschool special . \" even worse , in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people , the studio got a case of the heebie - jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re - shoot scenes and cut footage to \" tone things down . \" needless to say , the filmmaker was frustrated . \" we were trying to make a cautionary tale , \" he told newsweek , \" and we couldn ' t show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from . \" regardless , the film works , thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes . \" crazy / beautiful \" is quality fare , good enough that i half - expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for \" failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes . \" set in pacific palisades , calif . , the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens . every morning and evening , carlos nunez ( jay hernandez ) takes a two - hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school . an honor student and star athlete , carlos is responsible , modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy . all is well until he meets nicole oakley ( kirsten dunst ) , the daughter of a rich congressman ( bruce davison ) . nicole is a drunk apparently hell - bent on self - destruction . carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her , but he is only human and she has the greatest smile . plus , as her father notes , she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral . as with \" save the last dance , \" \" crazy / beautiful \" ( god , how i hate lower - case titles ) takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh . while noting the racial and social differences between the kids , the screenplay dances around most of the clich ? s ( there are still several mtv moments , though ) . the filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there . cute - as - a - button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicole ' s behavior . she is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down , i hoped the boy would listen . as carlos , hernandez is a revelation . hunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team , the young man can really act ; we will see a lot of this guy in the future . aside from its title , the biggest problem with \" crazy / beautiful \" is its ending , which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy . after carefully presenting credible characters and situations , the conclusion feels rushed and lazy . still , this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots . \" afterschool special \" my ass ? \" crazy / beautiful \" is the real deal .", "warner brothers has scored another marketing coup . the one - two punch was started in the summer , with the release of batman forever . trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat , ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel . carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever - wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video ( $ 11 . 99 at wal - mart ) ; a mere two weeks before carrey ' s return in this marketwise , but misfired comedy . ace ventura : when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubber - faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment . he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher , in batman forever , but , here , left to his own devices , carrey quickly wears out his welcome . the opening sequence is by far the best -- an amusing spoof of cliffhanger , with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon . ( you can guess what happens to mr . paws . hint : it sounds like splat . ) the plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas , and then to not - so - darkest africa , where ace is on the case of a missing white bat . with his hair and limbs both wildly askew , carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes . the rest of the film is just more of the same . sure , the plot ' s linear , and the production values solid , but where is the scripted humor to support carrey ' s sloppy slathering ? writer and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set - ups . instead , carrey just mugs away , playing for the camera even when most of it isn ' t funny . the better gags have been shown in the ads , though a bit with ace emerging buck - naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see . though an arguable improvement over the original , ace ventura : when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten . the script is virtually devoid of wit . tribal mask jokes ? jerry lewis cameos ? forget it . if anything , the inexplicable presence of simon callow ( four weddings and a funeral ) and bob gunton ( the shawshank redemption ) suggests that working with carrey is the classical actor ' s ultimate challenge . just how long * can * they keep a straight face ?", "what would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movie ? a better question , what would inspire a studio to produce said movie ? if you have an answer , let me know . foolish , the new movie written by and starring master p is a jaw - droppingly horrible film , one with no redeeming value socially , cinematically or otherwise . comedically it has some potential , but only in its stand - up comedy moments , which i can turn on comedy central for . master p stars as fifty dollah ' ( beat that ! ) as a mobster ( i think ) who is trying to start a comedy club / act with his little brother foolish ( eddie griffin ) . but the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss ( played by andrew dice clay , for the very first time entertaining ) , a stubborn club owner and family problems ( the latter in foolish is a perfect example of roger ebert ' s \" idiot plot , \" if everyone here wasn ' t an idiot , there would be no problem ) so what does foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names ? not a hell of a lot . as i have mentioned , master p cannot act or write . he acts like the rapper that he is . the occasional despair that his script requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced , as are his warm and fuzzy scenes with his little bro . as for his script -- well , i suppose he delivers what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting experience . if you haven ' t yet figured it out , that is not saying much . co - star eddie griffin ( really the star of the show ) is quite a different story . the fact of the matter is that griffin , whose most significant screen outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show malcolm and eddie on the fledgling upn network , is an extremely talented comedian , stand - up and otherwise . he has much in common with chris tucker ( rush hour , money talks ) in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips . he spouts profanity with impressive dexterity ( to the extent which that can be done ) , and while i hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes in this movie . and indeed , i laughed at a few stand - up scenes here , but from a feature - length movie i expect more . foolish provided me with no reason to care for these characters . every scene which has any potential for dramatic impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke ( in a scene where tension escalates between the two brothers , foolish blurts out towards his jewelry - sporting sibling \" you lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going to be a gold rush \" ) or something even more idiotic such as foolish smashing his own car ( to which i said , a bit too loudly for the occasion \" huh ? \" ) after getting slightly upset with his wife . believe me when i say that there is nothing in foolish that warrants parting with your hard - earned $ 8 . you ' ll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of comedy central or any virtually any sitcom if you don ' t have cable . eddie griffin fans may enjoy this derivative ( although offensive ) yarn , but everyone else should stay the hell away . &# 137 ;", "pre - review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is \" sex \" , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review . because of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of \" sex \" ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \\ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it ' s most likely just another way of referring to \" sex \" . i think we ' d all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review . though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what . body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you ' d normally expect to see a violent attack . it ' s about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it . these are things we all do , sometimes . the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts . their lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed . it ' s as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek . at its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition . michael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say . his characters don ' t communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera . they voice simplistic platitudes like \" i like to come \" or \" sex without love equals violence \" . huh ? and yes that is as complex as this movie ' s observations get . the characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more . the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events . we meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy . i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot . i ' m not trying to be clever or witty , but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others . with the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other -- a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin . i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( \" sex without love equals violence \" ) . in between all the confessionals , cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning . the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me . this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining . if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k - obsessed , fine , i don ' t have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way , but cristoffer only gives us one side . additionally that one side isn ' t even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness . or realism . one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters . they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn ' t it erotic , it isn ' t real . it doesn ' t feel like an authentic sexual encounter . every f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner . body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film . it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it . the resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow . the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred . the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off . this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can ' t think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80 ' s next to wall street . unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off . paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded . it was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall - out of such a decision . the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them . he gave them heart . cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones . he preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us . this is not the way to get any message across . why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin ' skins ? cristofer kind of does that , though without an ounce of insight , and with a helping of leering exploitation .", "david lynch ' s \" blue velvet \" begins and ends with colorful , bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in a seemingly perfect american town . however , what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is a \" strange world \" of drug dealers , sadists , and murderers . the opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy , disturbing film . they show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances . odd would be a perfect adjective to describe this film , its characters , its direction , and its story . thankfully , the obscurity that \" blue velvet \" relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable . since its elements are so originally weird , you never know what will happen next . this is the main goal of a movie ; to be spontaneous and surprising . \" blue velvet \" miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting . lynch creates such a hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling . the film starts off with the discovery of a severed ear by a college boy ( kyle maclachlan ) . from this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer ( isabella rossellinia ) who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping . the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch ' s story telling so amazing . maclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship , in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of a high school flick , and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends . through these multiple stories , maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan , we are introduced to a variety of interesting subplots . lynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion . instead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times . lynch has been known to do this with a number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get a hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine . however , for fans of odd difficult indies , \" blue velvet \" could be just what they are looking for . it is very hard to discuss \" blue velvet \" without discussing the performance of dennis hopper ' s sadistic frank . most of the other actors in the film were not very memorable . kyle maclachlan lacked one important aspect for his role , a personality . laura dern was consistently annoying . but dennis hopper stole every scene he was in . his evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession to velvet to his incessant breathing from a gas mask . frank is a character that comes along once in a blue moon . many producers know this and have inevitably begun to typecast hopper as the bad guy . just like his villain in \" speed \" , hopper is over the edge with cursing and screaming every chance he has to speak . this harshness is exactly what frank is , so weird and twisted that it is hard not to look at him , even if he theatens you to look away . \" blue velvet \" has characters and stories you will never see in a movie again . for this sole reason it is recommended . but also see it to admire lynch ' s obsession to avoid the norm . even if this film is a little too weird for you , it ' s hard not to congratulate a guy for trying something new and sticking to it .", "i have to admit that i disliked this film initially . it certianly isn ' t for every taste , and it ' s sheer torture to sit through if you ' re in a restless mood . that said , if you are in the right mood , it ' s absolutely incredible . this was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo - in for first in almost any other year . perhaps the big turn - off for many was this film ' s unconventionality . i ' d be hard - pressed to compare it to any other film that i ' ve seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully . on my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn ' t think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it ) . the first act serves to set up the characters - sort of . it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom . and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie ) . the majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice - overs . the artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes . the battle scenes are amazing ( second only to \" saving private ryan \" in my opinion ) . they ' re brutal , horrifying , and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography . the second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen . the only problems come during the first and third acts . malick takes a little too long to get the film started . although the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers ' experiencing a near - eden - like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle - are effective and necessary , hints of pretentiousness sink in . the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this . the final act is effective at winding the film down , but the problems from the first persist - it ' s a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times . that said , there are two sequences ( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife , and another where one of the main characters is killed ) that are nothing short of incredible . the performances are phenominal all around . the two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel , both of whom should have been nominated for oscars . nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation . his character is hard , mean , and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men , and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him . caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war , his place in it , and if there ' s any deeper meaning to the hell that he ' s going through . he is absolutely perfect - genuine , sympathetic , sincere , and yet strong when he needs to be . although restricted to a relatively small role , sean penn is also very good as the company ' s pessimistic seargent . as to how it stacks up to \" saving private ryan \" - it was my second favorite movie of 1998 , \" ryan \" was my first . it ' s really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i won ' t , beyond saying that spielberg ' s film had more of an impact on me . however , the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality ( i can easily see why someone would \" the thin red line \" above \" ryan ) . i highly recommend both of them , and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made . all in all , \" the thin red line \" is filmmaking of an incredibly high order . it ' s slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right . it ' s a real shame that it tanked at the box office - films this unconventional , powerful , and thought - provoking don ' t come along very often .", "when i left the theater after seeing david lynch ' s \" lost highway , \" i remarked to a fellow movie - goer , \" i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears . \" in his first feature film in five years , lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture \" eraserhead \" on the weirdness scale . you won ' t \" know \" what happened when it ' s over , though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses . it is difficult to describe the plot of this film , because it depends partly on how you interpret it . i can , however , describe what we see on the screen : l . a . jazz saxophonist fred madison ( bill pullman ) and his wife renee ( patricia arquette ) , whom he clearly suspects of infidelity , receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep . they are , naturally enough , more than a little frightened and confused , and it doesn ' t help matters any when \" mystery man \" ( robert blake ) approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons ' house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving . the next morning , fred finds another videotape which , to his ( and our ) surprise , shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom . he is convicted of her murder and sent to death row , where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton ( balthazar getty ) . the perplexed prison officials release dayton , whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways - most notably his affair with alice wakefield ( arquette again ) , a blonde who is otherwise renee ' s spitting image , and another encounter with the mystery man . i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more , but suffice it to say that lynch doesn ' t offer any neat wrap ? ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of \" lost highway \" are out in full force from beginning to end . this description might make \" lost highway \" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch ' s weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time . on the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch ' s previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther . the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery . there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings - on here . we , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred ' s , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent . all of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch ' s typically slow - paced , idiosyncratic style . as is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in \" lost highway \" it works perfectly . there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred ' s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil ' s \" song to the siren \" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically \" happening \" in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity . lynch ' s direction and director of photography pete deming ' s darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story . well , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer ' s attention because of its tie - ins to the original mystery . the main characters in this \" reality \" - dayton ( a well - meaning but none too intelligent 24 - year - old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn - star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you couldn ' t find in any of the two dozen \" pulp fiction \" wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film ' s spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch . lynch ' s typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here . it ' s not exactly exploitative - like almost everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off . that said , these minor flaws don ' t prevent \" lost highway \" from attaining its place as one of the darkest , most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years . it is a one - way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind , and as such it is gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective .", "the coen brothers are back again , this time with homer ' s \" odyssey \" as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in \" o brother , where art thou ? \" right for the beginning of \" o brother \" the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song . the camera flows around the hard toiling men , giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes - ulysses everett mcgill ( george clooney ) , delmar ( tim blake nelson ) and pete ( john turturro ) - escaping across a cotton field . it is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio . a strong suite , as always with the coen brothers , is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films . their characters are goofy and comical , like nicolas cage in \" raising arizona \" ; or , dramatic , as albert finney and john turturro in \" miller ' s crossing \" ; and , even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in \" fargo . \" in all cases , and in \" o brother , \" too , the characters populating their films are three - dimensional people . ulysses everett is a handsome , hair - obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department . but , he seems like a genius when compared to the simple , sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete , who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $ 1 . 2 million . their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer ' s original material as they meet all manner of people along the way , including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money . there is magic , too , when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens . the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys ' adventures , giving the flick a choppy , episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow . some of the interludes are an epiphany , though . the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar - playing tommy johnson ( chris thomas king ) and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere , run by its blind owner ( stephen root ) . they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledge , are recorded as they sing the traditional tune , \" i am a man of constant sorrow . \" it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us , in my mind , the best movie song of the year . contrasting this and other wonderful moments ( the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind ) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of \" o brother . \" in particular , near the end , is a scene where ulysses , delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched . the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of \" the wizard of oz . \" they don ' t say \" lions and tigers and bears , oh my ! \" and there ' s no dorothy , but it is the land of oz we ' re seeing here . the highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels . george clooney is funny , charming , a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today . he has the charm of a 30 ' s movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity . ulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair , risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets . his vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical hero - wanderer . while clooney is the name draw for \" o brother , \" the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar . the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who , at one point , hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism . delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine . the taciturn pete , as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro , is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst . all together , the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons , albeit brave ones . the colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet and get to know along the way of the boys ' odyssey . charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy o ' daniel , who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for re - election . john goodman is wicked as the one - eyed bible salesman and con artist , big dan teague . michael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary , george \" babyface \" nelson . stephen root is amusing as the blind dj , rep ' ing one of the many references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways . holly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses ' estranged wife , penny ( and the real reason for this adventure , not secret treasure ) . techs are , as expected in a coen brothers venture , first class . cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked on five previous coen films , captures the sultry atmosphere of the south . the photography complements the lush period production and costume provided by dennis gassner and mary zophres , respectively . once again , roderick jaynes - the alter ego of ethan and joel coen - is on board as editor . the high points outweigh the low through most of \" o brother , where art thou ? \" with particular praise for the wonderful selection of period and traditional music . i give it a b .", "i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory . this was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this . not only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie . the very fast - paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast - talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city . gibson ' s performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films . gibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better . the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique . try to imagine a toned - downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover - ups . if you can imagine that , then you ' ve basically got jerry fletcher . in many ways , i was surprised by this movie . to begin with , i was surprised at how good it was . don ' t get me wrong , it ' s not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie . secondly , i was surprised at mel gibson ' s performance . he provided a fantastic performance . the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all - out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense . gibson ' s character has an almost uncountable number of one - liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film . for instance , jerry ' s apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable . and last , i was surprised at how good the plot is . writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher ' s far - fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland ' s own opinions . mel gibson isn ' t the only stand - out in the film . julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can ' t seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories . he also seems obsessed and in love with her . but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him . jerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) . although he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition . very soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) . after barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton . the remainder of the film is almost always fast - paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry ' s life being constantly put into jeopardy . and more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry ' s life . many things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience . for instance , the meaning of the book \" the catcher in the rye \" and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g . lee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead . make sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above . definitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it . i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action - thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations . and even if you aren ' t , you should still like this film .", "metro i ' ve seen san francisco in movies many times . there was 1994 ' s interview with the vampire and most recently the rock . now , yet again , san francisco is the setting for this movie . eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper of the sfpd . he is their top hostage negotiator , and the very best at what he does . when his best friend on the force is killed by joe ( michael wincott , in a terrific performance ) , a psychotic , demented jewel thief , roger makes it his mission to capture the guy before he strikes again . meanwhile , roper tries to rekindle a relationship with his british ex - girlfriend veronica , while helping to rear a new up and comer from swat who ' s an expert sniper and marksman ( michael rappaport ) . despite the obligatory cop movie scenes ( does every cop / new partner movie have to start the same way ? ) where the sgt . assigns roper a partner , roper confronts the sarge , etc . , this film is still one heck of an explosive ride . a scene involving a cable car has to be seen to be believed , and boasts some amazing car stunts . eddie murphy shines in this tailor - made role , and for once , his character shows depth and concern . when confronting joe in prison , you can feel the anger drip from every word . michael rappaport is basically throwaway . he serves no purpose , except to be buddy to murphy and get disabled in the final reel so that eddie can save the day . typical action escapist fare . michael wincott offers the best performance as the crazed killer and jewel thief joe . never before have i seen such a villian written like this where i could actually believe that he was serious and take him seriously . maybe i just thought that this role was different due to wincott ' s perfectly raspy voice . i don ' t know . what i do know , though , is that although metro is basically a typical action retread , it manages to cover new ground and shed new light on tired old cliches ' . the film is a triumph , and an entertaining one at that . it doesn ' t meander or trail off from its main character . an enjoyable two hours , metro is enjoyable , witty , action - packed , and fun , and makes for a great action movie that ' s perfect for all of us that need an escape from reality .", "when i arrived in paris in june , 1992 , i was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks : fire walk with me , since the movie wasn ' t scheduled to open in the u . s . until late august . happily , the film -- the prequel to david lynch ' s cult television series -- was playing in a fancy , thx theater . unfortunately , the theater was far more impressive than the movie , which absolutely stinks , much like a french lavatory . worse , actually . fire walk with me ( directed by lynch ) will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read \" laura palmer ' s secret diary . \" for \" twin peaks \" junkies , like me , the movie is only marginally improved . the plot is jumbled and illogical , not to mention excruciatingly sluggish . the first 30 minutes , which have almost nothing to do with the main story line , feature chris isaak and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating a murder in portland , oregon . the movie then stops in philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper . lynch then drops this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks , washington -- one year later . ah , twin peaks : \" familiar territory , \" you think to yourself as angelo badalamenti ' s distinctive musical score chimes in . wrong ! the movie proves that you really can ' t go home again , or at least lynch can ' t . only about a quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie : leland palmer , bobby briggs , james , shelly , leo , the log lady and a few others -- mostly in meaningless cameos . the rest of the \" twin peaks \" cast is nowhere to be seen , and consequently , lynch fails to recreate the spirit and flavor of tv ' s most enigmatic town . cast members michael ontkean , sherilyn fenn , piper laurie , and richard beymer are sorely missed , not to mention lara flynn boyle , who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna . the movie concentrates solely on laura palmer ( sheryl lee ) as she suffers through drug abuse , prostitution , and incest , during her miserable last seven days on earth . the night of laura ' s death , which is truly terrifying , is the film ' s only remotely effective sequence . we finally get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james ' motorcycle and ran into the woods at that lonely traffic light in the middle of nowhere . her murder unfolds just as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series , which is gratifying for faithful \" twin peaks \" viewers . but it ' s an awfully small reward for sitting through a painfully awful movie .", "quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers . after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs . john travolta made his come - back and is now one of today ' s most bankable stars . bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor . jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier . most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she ' s never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert - written beyond the valley of the dolls ) . that is , until now . jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction . after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing . jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment . despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another . pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent -- samuel l . jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster . more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations . describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can ' t say much or you spoil it for everyone else . i will tread lightly . jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport . the camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation . we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers . . . for a hefty price . ms . brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away . however , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l . a . cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money . they try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell ' s buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead . they try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong - doing . but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell ' s friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail . ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops . after she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison . ordell doesn ' t like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track . this scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal . revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that ' s the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film . tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably . his hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way . they talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends . of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise . and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop . of course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs - style storytelling to it . things are told from one person ' s perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more . this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side . on the technical side of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film . however , this time around it isn ' t as nearly as impressive or original . the writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino ' s use of slang terms offensive . the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it ' s much more easy to understand . his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to follow , especially considering that the time is given during the \" leaps \" in time . perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel \" rum punch \" by elmore leonard . the dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are fully realized . the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good . and as with pulp fiction , the music is a highlight , bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s . the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable . the performances are incredibly rich , with hidden meaning behind every characters ' actions . nothing is quite as it seems , and you can ' t really tell which side one person is on . the real treat , of course , is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown . her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which play an important role in the film . watching grieg , i could tell what was going through her mind , even if i didn ' t know what she was thinking . her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought . bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato . i didn ' t even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham ' s in boogie nights ) . michael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen . chris tucker has a small , but effective performance . samuel l . jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) . but no matter . . . jackson is very strong in his role . robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell ' s perspective clients and friends . robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most developed characters . he is present throughout most of the film , and he holds his own against jackson and grier . jackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks . as a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment , with a complex plot to draw viewers in . however , one can not help but compare it to tarantino ' s pulp fiction , and expect great results . when compared , it comes up short , but not that short . it ' s a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino . perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress . i can ' t remember seeing her in anything ( except for a small role in mars attacks ! ) , but hopefully she will get many more roles from this one . expect to see her name floating around the oscar nominations ( and hopefully she will even be able to nab one ) .", "one of my brother ' s favorite movies is h . b . halicki ' s 1974 cult flick \" gone is sixty seconds , \" one of the best products of the car - chase genre that provided drive - in fare during the 1970 ' s . chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue , but they had a strong visceral appeal . although it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars , the remake of \" gone in sixty seconds \" is relatively weak and dull . randall \" memphis \" raines ( nicolas cage ) is a retired car thief who runs a go - cart track . he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip ( giovanni ribisi ) would not take up boosting cars . however , kip became a thief anyway , and now he ' s in big trouble . kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri ( christopher eccleston ) by the end of the week . calitri expects memphis to fulfill kip ' s bargain ; if he doesn ' t come through , kip dies . memphis gathers his old crew ( angelina jolie , robert duvall , will patton , chi mcbride , and vinnie jones ) , and kip brings his boys ( t . j . cross , william lee scott , scott caan , and james duval ) . as if calitri breathing down their necks wasn ' t bad enough , the team is pursued by a cop ( delroy lindo ) who ' s still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster ( rap star master p ) who wants to take over calitri ' s clients . watching \" gone , \" i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one . maybe that ' s why the first forty - nine are fairly easy , and the thrills are saved for \" eleanor , \" a 1967 shelby gto , a model that has always eluded memphis . but the big chase doesn ' t live up to the long wait . i had high hopes for \" gone \" because it is director dominic sena ' s second film . \" kalifornia , \" his 1993 debut , was a brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience . in that movie sena took a simple thriller plot ( a couple gives a serial killer a ride ) and successfully endowed it with deeper significance . in \" gone \" he seems to be aiming for a drama about two brothers who can ' t communicate with each other , but that goal just doesn ' t mesh with this plot . \" gone \" either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough . it ' s not light enough to be fun , or mean enough to be intense . this chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it . the lack of action is a waste of the premise , which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever . the weak script is a waste of a talented cast . in a \" newsweek \" interview last year , sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies . much as i like cage , for every good picture he does ( \" leaving las vegas , \" \" bringing out the dead \" ) , there are two major stinkers ( \" snake eyes , \" \" con air , \" \" 8mm , \" \" city of angels \" ) . that ratio is probably better than what a lot of his peers can boast , but cage has real talent . it ' s a shame to waste it in glitzy , superficial tripe like \" gone in 60 seconds . \"", "capsule : side - splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end . . . but not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs . most comedies these days have one flaw . they ' re not funny . they think they ' re funny , but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly . occasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem : ruthless people , for instance , which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end . liar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny . this is one of the few movies i ' ve seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through : instead of a couple of set - pieces that inspired a laugh ( think of the dismal fatal instinct ) , the whole movie works like clockwork . jim carrey playes a high - powered lawyer , to whom lying is as natural as breathing . there is one thing he takes seriously , though : his son , and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away . but his wife is divorced and seeing another man , and now it looks like they may move away together . the son goes with them , of course . the movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carrey ' s over - the - top persona with reality . then the plot springs into action : after being snubbed ( not deliberately ) by his father at his birthday , the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles : that for just one day , dad can ' t lie . he gets the wish . what happens next is sidesplitting . everything turns into a confrontation : when cornered by a bum for some change , he shouts , \" no ! i ' m not giving you any money because i know you ' ll spend it on booze ! all i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society ! \" he can ' t even get into an elevator without earning a black eye . and what ' s worse , he ' s now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture . carrey , who i used to find unfunny , has gotten better at his schtick , even if it ' s a limited one . he uses it to great effect in this movie . there is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process ( there ' s a grin breaking out across my face right now , just remembering the scene ) . he can ' t even write the lie ; his fingers twitch , his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning , and when he tries to talk it ' s like he ' s speaking in tongues . equally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp ( don ' t ask why ) , tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom ( it fails , with semi - predictable results ) , and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them . this scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end . the movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end . a shame , too , because the movie insists on having a big , ridiculous climax that involves carrey ' s character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs , then breaking his leg , etc . a simple reconciliation would do the trick . why is this stupid pent - up climax always obligatory ? it ' s not even part of the movie ' s real agenda . thankfully , liar liar survives it , and so does carrey . maybe they were being merciful , on reflection . if i ' d laughed any more , i might have needed an iron lung .", "\" party camp , \" is one of the most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i ' ve seen in awhile . a late rip - off of the \" meatballs \" series , the film follows a group of young camp counselors at camp chipmunk . that ' s really about all that can be said about the \" plot \" because nothing much happens , except that the main character , wise - cracking jerry ( andrew ross ) , has the hots for a cute blonde ( kerry brennan ) , and there is a big contest in the climax . how fun ! since , \" party camp , \" has practically no screenplay and there is no talent at all involved , the least the makers could have done was make it raunchy and exploitative . it ' s not that i think exploitation is necessarily a good quality , but when you are talking about a dull turkey like this , the least that could have been done would be to fill it with a lot of mindless sex . even a psychopathic slasher at the camp would have done the trick . at least , then , it wouldn ' t have been such a chore to sit through . never before have i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat . the comedy was easy to spot , but it wasn ' t the least bit funny . it was groan - inducing . constantly throghout , i was asking myself if director gary graver actually thought this movie was worth anything . so what saves , \" party camp , \" from the dreaded zero star rating ? well , that ' s simple : jewel shepard , as a flighty bimbo , was admittedly fun to watch . although nothing could have saved this film from the lowest depths of motion picture trash , at least if the film had centered on shepard , she might have been able to add a little spice to an otherwise rancid , low - budget teen comedy .", "plot : a separated , glamorous , hollywood couple must pretend to reunite for a press junket of the last movie that they ever shot together . kewl . . . now i only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie . . . critique : trite , unfunny , boring and a waste of everyone ' s talent . how a premise with such zest and bite can turn into a movie that doesn ' t feature any chemistry , any real laughs , any surprises or any spice is beyond me . how julia roberts is used solely as a \" puppy dog \" character , puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zeta - jones ' character , who is not one bit funny or romantic ( two ideal ingredients in a \" romantic comedy \" ) , is also beyond me . and why they chose john cusack , a great , quirky actor in his own right , to play the most bland , uninteresting and unfetching character ( with zero chemistry with either of his leads ) is further more , beyond me . and to anybody who decided that this project was \" funny \" enough to greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above , along with billy crystal , christopher walker , seth green and stanley tucci . . . well , what can i say . . . i just don ' t have the words . so is this the worst movie that i ' ve seen all year ? no . but it definitely sucks and it ' s basically because . . . well , it ' s just not funny . and for the record , allow me to state a few more problems with it . it starts off slow , it ' s got no energy , it doesn ' t engage you with any of its characters ( julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film , everyone else . . . lame ! ) , it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward , it ' s utterly predictable , standard , routine , see - through and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the screen , big and ugly , waiting . . . waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing . and then hank azaria shows up . . . aaaaaah , the film ' s savior ( mind you , some might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype , but that ' s another story altogether ) . but when an experienced \" voice \" actor upstages all of the main stars in a summer \" blockbuster \" romantic comedy with an over - the - top antonio banderas accent , damn dude . . . your film ' s in trouble ! ! rent this movie on video just to see what went wrong yourself . the references to ricky ricardo and senor wences ( huh ! ? ) , the idio - plot points like when one of the characters goes on the roof to stretch his arms out and relax , but everyone believes that he ' s going to kill himself ( hardy - har - har ) and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave the theater laughing by bringing back a ball -

star tommy lee jones . winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i - do - my - job - whether - they - are - innocent - or - guilty roles . people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right . though i don ' t think he will win another oscar again . the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons . even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer , the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count . burglary , assault , grand theft auto are some of libby ' s slipups . the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you ' re innocent of the major crime . hopefully criminals won ' t use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent . that would just be plain stupid .", "1 . he doesn ' t have a hard - to - decipher accent , 2 . he doesn ' t always speak in a monotone , and 3 . his face doesn ' t always wear the same impassive expression . in short , the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad , but too bad to be good . unfortunately , the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle , firestorm , which is just plain awful . one of the most glaring problems with long ( who made his acting debut in john woo ' s broken arrow ) is that he ' s so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery . as ace firefighter jesse graves , long is supposed to be playing a bigger - than - life action hero -- the kind of he - man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers . unfortunately , despite the best efforts of first - time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner ' s work in the postman look stark , jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy . to put it kindly , this is not a well - written motion picture . firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich ? s which , taken together , form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot . the only reason this film is getting one star ( instead of something lower ) is that most of the fire sequences are realistic , and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively . we ' re introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people . during this sequence , our big burly hero proves that he ' s also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl and her dog ( yes , the dog lives ) from being broiled alive . flash - forward a year . now , our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association , replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins ( real actor scott glenn ) . but this day , our big burly hero ' s first in charge , isn ' t going to be business - as - usual . a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom . led by randy earl shaye ( william forsythe ) , the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border . along the way , they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress ( suzy amis ) . eventually , our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire , rescue the damsel in distress , defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , and restore order to the galaxy . firestorm ' s director , dean semler , is a former cinematographer ( he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves ) , so it ' s no surprise that the film looks good . unfortunately , that ' s firestorm ' s lone asset , and it falters near the end , when computer - generated special effects fill up the screen . these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game . the action sequences , which include a variety of chases , are occasionally interesting , but never invigorating . everyone , including long , appears to be going through the motions . there isn ' t a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end , unless you count the forest fire , which generates some heat . as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , william forsythe lacks panache . he ' s worse than a generic bad guy ; he ' s a boring generic bad guy who doesn ' t have any snappy one - liners to hurl at our big burly hero . my advice to scott glenn ( absolute power ) and suzy amis ( titanic ) is to accidentally forget this film the next time they ' re making out a resume . there ' s some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list . ( at least i hope there aren ' t 10 worse films than this . ) and i know i wasn ' t the only one who really disliked this movie . as the audience was filing out of the screening , i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments . the general consensus seemed to be that , although the movie sucked , the promotional key ring was cool . the problem is that fox won ' t be giving out key rings to regular movie - goers , so that nixes any reason to see firestorm .", "weir is well - respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject - matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post - traumatic stress disorder ) among them . in the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now - tired concept of media - manipulation by tackling the material from the inside - out . it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top - form playing the title character , truman burbank . by now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24 - 7 peep - show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants . ` seahaven ' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras . for 30 years , truman suspects nothing -` we accept the reality we ' re given , ' poses christof - but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in ` fiji ' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him . thus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly - rated program . in a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second - reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three - quarters through . this allows us to comprehend and accept truman ' s world before we contextualize it . for all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it . truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed . the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey - he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide - eyed bewilderment . cinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images . as well , it employs wojciech kilar ' s piece \" zycie za zycie ' masterfully and beautifully . if the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney ' s characterization as meryl , truman ' s \" wife \" ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman ' s ` father ' , which feels curiously incomplete . there are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman ' s audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film . they wear buttons asking ` how will it end ? ' i couldn ' t wait to know myself , though i didn ' t exactly want it to end , for this inspired movie is possibly the best - and most complex - summer picture in years .", "niagara niagara ( r ) bob gosse ' s niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young - lovers - on - the - road movies . wild marcy ( robin tunney ) and calm seth ( henry thomas ) meet cute , literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store . a mere couple of scenes later , the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small , unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants . along the way , true love inevitably blossoms . what sets niagara niagara apart , though , is that marcy is afflicted with tourette ' s syndrome , a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics . tunney , displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft , delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year ' s venice film festival . to term her work a tour - de - force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery ; tunney ' s effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability , which makes her depiction of marcy ' s illness -- which often causes her to act violently -- that much more convincing and tragic . she and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off - kilter chemistry . their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way , mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss . a detour involving a kindly widower ( michael parks ) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt , and the key character of a trigger - happy pharmacist ( stephen lang ) is highly unbelievable . but these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney ' s bravura turn , which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved .

' the rainmaker ' plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters . in the background rudy ' s voice narrates his feelings and makes half - cynical jokes about the legal profession in general . two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be . first , rudy ' s time is split juggling three cases , rather than concentrating on a single high - stakes case . also , rudy ' s use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge . the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win , and rudy narrates his way into coming of age .", "field of dreams almost defies description . although it ' s about baseball , it ' s not a baseball movie . although the film is extremely spiritual , it ' s not about religion . and although field of dreams is melodramatic , it ' s not a tearjerker . to really understand what field of dreams is all about , you have to see it . in the film , kevin costner plays ray kinsella , a baseball fan , ' 60s berkeley graduate , and iowa farmer . one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields , ray hears a voice ; it tells him : \" if you build it , he will come . \" then ray has a vision and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn , shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again . and even though it depletes his family ' s savings and his neighbors think he ' s crazy , ray clears away the corn and builds a baseball field , complete with bleachers and flood lights . \" if you build it , he will come . \" and lo and behold , shoeless joe does come -- bringing with him several of his dead teammates . and then ray hears the voice again ; it tells him to \" ease his pain . \" ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann , an influential and radical novelist from the ' 60s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society . with great aplomb , james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on a magical and spiritual journey . the cast in field of dreams is excellent , especially kevin costner in the lead role . costner gives a quiet , subtle , and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life . costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale . amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray ' s feisty and loving wife , who against her better judgement supports her husband ' s crazy ideas . in her most impressive scene , madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p . t . a . meeting , displaying the sincere passion of a ' 60s berkeley radical . ray liotta is appropriately eerie and awe - inspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe , the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the 1919 chicago \" black sox \" scandal . and finally , burt lancaster is memorable in a small , but important , role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning . field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life , wonder , mystery , spirit , and humor . it , for the most part , succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief . ray kinsella ' s spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous . but while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama , it unfortunately does at times go overboard , and by the end it gets down - right sappy . in general , however , field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasy -- one i can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics .", "i ' ve heard it called \" jaws with claws \" and that ' s a fair summation of the plot , though that tag line does little to quantify quality . director stephen hopkins ( blown away , predator 2 ) and screenwriter william goldman ( maverick , misery ) would have you believe that this is an epic historical drama about man against nature , based on what really happened in africa to the railroad workers trying to build a bridge to the 20th century . they ' ve stacked the deck with two big stars ( val kilmer , michael douglas ) , a bigger production design , beautiful photography ( by academy award winner vilmos zsigmond ) , and a score so overblown that it makes the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music . the movie doesn ' t make a lick of sense , though , either as an epic or as your basic boo - fest . in fact , some of the bits are so laughably ludicrous that you may think you ' ve stumbled into the sequel to mystery science theater 3000 : the movie . how about the three guys with rifles , who trap a lion and then can ' t even hit the damned thing ? or the ham -

aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steve speirs ) - don ' t offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca ( mena suvari ) , chambermaid to the queen of france ( catherine deneuve ) . scripter gene quintano and director - cinematographer peter hyams are primarily interested in the derring - do , as evidenced by choreographer xin - xin xiong ' s elaborate - but not original - stunts , including a fast - paced stagecoach chase , a tavern brawl on rolling barrels , high - wire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes , and a ladder - fight sequence . filmed in southern france , the scenery , sets and costumes are spectacular , but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy , restless mtv ' ish cuts . as the swashbuckling d ' artagnan , bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing , totally lacking on - screen charisma , not to mention acting skill . mena suvari , so impressive in \" american beauty , \" seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" the musketeer \" is a cinematic but shallow 3 . \" all for one and one for all \" ? not this time ' round .", "those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo ' s novel les miserables . i don ' t know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel . i haven ' t even seen that . going into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical ) . walking away from it , i ' m kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material . writer / director bille august ' s film version is a straightforward , beautifully told film . liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean ; in the beginning , he has just been released from a 19 - year prison sentence . he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior . the priest ' s words of wisdom influence him , and he makes a vow to change himself . nine years later , we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo ; nobody knows his real name , and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago . conflicts arise when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assigned to vigo . valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him , and javert remembers jean to be a convict . javert is hell - bent on upholding the law , and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice . along the way , valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman , fantine ( uma thurman ) , and vows to take care of her daughter , cosette ( played later by claire danes ) . les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture . the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast , and the sets don ' t look like sets ( they look like real towns and villages ) ; gabriella pescucci ' s costumes are noticeably spectacular . basil poledouris ' soundtrack is thick and usually well - placed ( though it does get a bit heavy at times ) . many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality , such as the climax , which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening . augusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow . he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately . i was also impressed that he didn ' t go overboard with flash and style , which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days ( such as baz luhrmann ' s vicious tragedy william shakespeare ' s romeo + juliet ) . this film feels solid and whole , and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested . liam neeson is terrific in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well , and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective . thurman , in her small role , is very good , and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non - glamorous role such as this one . rush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don ' t remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense . i can ' t be as charitable for danes , however ; though i know she is a talented actress , here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit . les miserables is , as i ' ve said , a solid , intelligent motion picture . my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy , and perhaps too staged . each scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris ' score , but i didn ' t always want them to be . for the most part , les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture . it ' s a good movie , and tells its story well , but august tends to hand - feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle . however , in a film this exciting and well - produced , a few minor flaws are easily overlooked .", "virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre . since ' dark city ' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another . the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix . all the films released after it , have been less successful . david cronenberg ' s existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone . and when ' the thirteenth floor ' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored . i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again . it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to ' the thirteenth floor ' . however , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak ' s latest picture . matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood ' s action and effects with an intelligent story . existenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness . ' the thirteenth floor ' is somewhere in between . instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , ' the thirteenth floor ' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding . in a near future . . . on the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real . right after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered . douglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth . a beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence . the first \" download into simulation \" is impressive . it is the creator ' s first visit to his world , his creation . in order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone ' s identity , become another person . this is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people \" wake up \" in unknown places and strange things start happen . they start to doubt in their own sanity . these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their \" users \" and creators with their sanity and their lives . it is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone ' s fantasy . with an appealing ( \" blade runner \" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present . our modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal . the thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile . this contrast demonstrates a wish for change . virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities . to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences . for others - a way to start over and \" correct \" their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past . virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life . at least that ' s how it is all beginning . but when you ' re waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise . this , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness . some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ? what is thought ? who are we ? if these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made . they are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner . the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer - simulated universes . kirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties . there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose ' s moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time . a rather unusual thing about ' the thirteenth floor ' is the almost complete lack of special effects . there are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion . this is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking . this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and ' dark city '- fans will be pleased . this film is interesting and inspiring . it has everything existenz doesn ' t , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix . and then there is a happy end which , like in ' dark city ' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context . the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and ' dark city ' . with this in mind , ' the thirteenth floor ' doesn ' t make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality .", "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . it ' s startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth . the lion king had just cracked $ 300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast . since then , though , disney ' s animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year ' s hercules successively proving less and less potent . with the once seemingly - impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox ' s anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid . while the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top - notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music . the film ' s storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince . what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions . from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she ' s resolutely smitten , and she ' s such a pure and endearing character that one can ' t help but invest their heart with her . this simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture . one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters . this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams ' much - heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities . while it ' s understandable that animated features lacking the name - recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto ' s use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia ' s showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it ' s unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy . do we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? is the film ' s entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? ( i ' m not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . ) fortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast . chief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film ' s heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms . benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film . ( she ' s the only reason i ' d even consider catching flubber . ) similarly , samuel e . wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab . he easily milks his lovable character ' s comic moments for all they ' re worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid ' s big tunes -- \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl \" -- have become the stuff of legend . pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea - witch ursula , while kenneth mars ' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel ' s father , king triton . in large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast . of course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . ashman ' s untimely death . not only are mr . menken ' s tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . ashman ' s charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film ' s storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character ' s dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film . mr . menken ' s score for the film is equally top - notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse - drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken ' s fine score . it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso - styled \" under the sea \" as joyfully crooned by mr . wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re - release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . benson ' s heartfelt rendition of the ballad \" part of your world \" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . ashman ) which , accompanied by the film ' s most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes . during the song ' s reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history . as of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney ' s limited 17 - day re - release of the little mermaid . there ' s no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film ' s reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney ' s dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox ' s costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia . in every respect , the re - release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film ' s 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $ 100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $ 10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively - marketed anastasia in head - to - head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film ' s opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney ' s odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away . but although disney ' s motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self - serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public . any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it ' s a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen . the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney ' s modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made .", "i have nothing against unabashedly romantic films . when done right , with at least slightly evident restraint , they can be engaging , sweeping , appealing . but it ' s a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle , a hollow , boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers ; the ones willing to buy into ephron ' s whiny views of life and romance . tom hanks and meg ryan , two of hollywood ' s most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed , repectively . baldwin ' s wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son , jonah , seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse . jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems . sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show , but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out . ephron has him do this so that annie reed ( meg ryan ) can hear it . annie is a happy woman . she is engaged to walter , an allergy - prone working man and seems to be perfectly content . but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show , she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it . five years after this movie hit theaters , hanks , ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better , although still sub - par romantic comedy you ' ve got mail , which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet . at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity . here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five . the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory . sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers ; from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie o ' donnell . but none of them can save the film from being a bore . its characters are dull and empty , its script isn ' t funny or particularly charming . the script has a fundamental problem : annie gives up , for little reason , her life with walter to pursue \" sleepless in seattle , \" whom she has never even seen . it ' s the kind of life decision that real people don ' t make , and its a major , unforgivable plausibility sacrifice . in essence , this movie ' s purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldn ' t even exist . it ' s a ten minute short film with ninety -

( in a running gag , porter demands $ 70 000 , but everybody mishears him and assumes he ' s after the entire $ 130 000 haul . ) in his travels ( or travails ) , porter encounters several other one - named villainous cretins like fairfax ( james coburn as a white - haired , millionaire thief ) and carter ( kristofferson , as a brown - haired , millionaire thief - the kingpin of the obligatory \" operation \" ) . helgeland ' s film ( which was recut by mel the producer ) is devoid of an imperative dime store charm . the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly : a ) because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs , and b ) because mel ' s schtick doesn ' t evolve from act one - he ' s the terminator stranded in a plot without a sci - fi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone . payback should have been called playback : it ' s a 102 - minute loop of the same short sequence .

( director of photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello , so va - va - va - voom in permanant midnight , to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig . ) to analyze such mediocrity is to grant payback far more attention than it deserves . perhaps only someone as experienced with antagonists - as - protagonists as tarantino - look what he did with the similar hero - less botched - robbery tale reservoir dogs - could have pulled off this material ( a loose remake of john boorman ' s point blank ) . the movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction ( all women are femme fatales ; even the cops are in on it , etc . ) and crosses them with the conventions of cheesy tv crime melodramas ( death is never in the cards for the main character , etc . ) but transcends neither .", "starring shawnee smith ; donovan leitch ; ricky paull goldin ; kevin dillon & billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960 ' s classic ( a term that i use very loosely to define the original ) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets in its way . now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel . the fact that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn ' t exactly hurt it either . fast forward to the late ' 80 ' s . steve mcqueen isn ' t in the remake ( this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years ) . nor is there any hollywood heavy hitters in the lead role . that is unless you count matt dillon ' s brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter . the other thing that works against this new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original . the only things you need now to have great special effects in a movie are deep pockets . it looks as if the produces of the new blob had a couple of holes in their pockets . the special effects in this movie are cheesy , like the original ' s . unlike the original , they don ' t look campy , they just look cheap . one bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith . she is very attractive and can actually act , which is more than i can say about some of her costars . in terms of plot , a little ball of pink goop falls from the sky . seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed up on a satellite . anyway , the pink stuff has a taste for humans . the more people it absorbs , the bigger it gets . and it isn ' t the friendliest goop on the block either . anyway , it attacks this little town and it ' s up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it . not really , but that is how it seems . this version attempts to recapture the camp of the original . as i ' ve already said , this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap , badly acted , and badly written than campy . in the years since this film was made none of the cast have gone on to greatness . although , star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon . the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple -- they all stunk out loud . although some of the film ' s smaller roles are filled with some actors that , while not big stars , are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles in other movies and tv shows . it also appears that the producers of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible . sadly , it doesn ' t work very well . if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town , then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original .

( ironically , it was within these past ten years that \" reality - based \" television have become a predominant fixture into our culture . who knew ? ) one - upping niccol , it was when unlikely candidate - director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place . weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone , deftly mixing capra with kafka , throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling . it was weir ' s first stroke of genius to create seahaven : a suburban paradise / prison that would make spielberg cower in shame . for example , bystander - extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of _dog fancy_ . the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to _not_ leave the island . credit weir for his second stroke : the casting of carrey . carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn \" on \" and act goofy whenever the camera is near . not here . his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on . and although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination ( just as well , the academy rarely honors goofy comedians , excepting robin williams ) , he stretches enough to alter his hyper - silly image considerably . playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey ' s life . no pun intended . better in a smaller , more pivotal role is ed harris as christof , who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13 \" work the problem , people \" character with dustin hoffman ' s megaglomaniac producer in _wag the dog_ , and then only slightly svengalian . it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and truman ' s well being . yes , in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son , and has provided the best universe he could provide . he thinks . rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone ( mrs . dalloway ) as carrey ' s true \" forbidden love \" , sylvia , very effective in another pivotal small role . laura linney ( congo ) and noah emmerich ( copland ) have the unfortunate task of playing truman ' s wife and best friend ; their sitcom - ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development . the exception is at the very beginning , where they speak into the camera , wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman , and for society in general . there are other little problems with the script . are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years ? was there any reason as to why in one scene , it rained solely on truman , even though it never had to ? how is it they hire hundreds of extras , and none of them could drive a boat , and yet truman , fearful of water , is helming a sailboat effortlessly ? and couldn ' t christof have turned off the wind , to strand truman at sea ? these little contrivances , however , do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work . the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show , and we are drawn to truman ' s mundane existence for no other reason than it is there . the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut . upon leaving the theater , i was looking up in the sky , wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome . just checking .", "one night , during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets , we went to see -- what else -- hard rain . \" so , are we all going to die ? \" the sheriff ( randy quaid ) asks in the story ' s opening line as he evacuates his flooded town . the answer is pretty much yes , but not nearly soon enough . and to add insult to injury , the supposedly dead , regretfully , often turn out not to be so . populating this bad tv - movie - of - the - week material are a host of talented actors . one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture . besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water , they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie . graham yost ' s script serves up one cliche after another for the actors , who thankfully managed to mumble quite a few of the lines . director mikael salomon ' s staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening . the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies , jr . ' s dark and ugly cinematography . the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water . onboard are guards tom and his uncle charlie . christian slater , who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart , plays tom . edward asner drops by briefly to take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie . coming to their \" rescue \" is a gang headed by jim , played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman . he views the loot , three million dollars worth , as his retirement plan . the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff and his posse tracking jim and his gang , who are in turn after tom . along the way , tom picks up a love interest in the person of a crucifix - weapon wielding woman named karen , played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver . the action sequences are repetitive and without much interest . they do feature lots of explosions and gunfire to keep you awake . christopher young ' s emotionless score for the film has a single trait , ear - shattering loudness . the plot holes are as big as the ones in the dam that breaks , submerging the town . the characters have an infinite number of bullets and rarely do they have to bother reloading their guns . the weapons and the ammunition spend most of the time under water or being rained on but always fire perfectly . when one of the bad guys drops a gun into the water , it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims to get it , even though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees . counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each other . the show has a single , but unprintable , good line . betty white plays an incessantly bossy wife , and , when her hen - pecked husband finally told her off , our audience roared with laughter . the show concludes with a sickening set of twists . the best that can be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed to laughably bad . hard rain runs 1 : 37 . it is rated r for violence and would be fine for teenagers .

( sunderland actually asks brenner , \" why was she killed ? \" to which i would have answered , \" if i knew , then the movie would already be over . \" ) only after we ' ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored . not that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot . in one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask . she sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring . instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner ' s houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap . this scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it ' s gratuitous and mean - spirited , but because it illustrates the film ' s complete disregard for the characters and the audience . it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise . i realized that these constructs on screen aren ' t actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story . this would have been bad enough without the west ' s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct . compelling films about sexual crimes don ' t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don ' t show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture . these scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they ' re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be . in addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it ' s a perversion of everything we know to be pure . this standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well - developed themes to back it up . as it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane . perhaps the only positive elements in the general ' s daughter are a couple of the performances . james woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety . i also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous . nonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization . the general ' s daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut - outs force - feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one - sided moral judgments .", "just in time for halloween and christmas , the reissue of the nightmare before christmas couldn ' t be more appropriate . with all of the attention thrown to \" family films \" in recent years , namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters , it ' s high time we raised the intellectual level of children ' s fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios . with that in mind , it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness it had seven years ago . nightmare is the story of one man ' s quest to discover his true purpose in life -- to look beyond the accolades of his peers , the achievements of his years , and the praise of his ego . jack skellington , the pumpkin king of halloweentown , is the main dude behind the halloween holiday for kids everywhere . but during his reign as pumpkin king , jack has somehow lost his understanding of his place in the world and the magic he creates with his halloween holiday . after the completion of one particular halloween season , jack walks with a heavy heart and ends up discovering in the woods outside halloweentown a grove of trees with doors to all of the other holidays in the world . imagine his surprise to discover christmastown , a far more impressive and uplifting holiday than halloween , surrounded by happy elves making toys , and with good cheer all around . upon his return to halloweentown , jack decides to combine halloween and christmas together by kidnapping \" sandy claws , \" employing all the residents of halloweentown to build toys for children . he then aims to take over the role as primary joy - provider and gift - bearer to the children of the world , in the hopes of rediscovering the zest for life he once had . alas , the co - mingling of halloween and christmas creates disastrous results involving shrunken heads , psychotic wooden ducks , a sleigh pulled by a phantom dog with a lighted nose , and a large , sinister , singing bag named oogie boogie tim burton -- the man behind such great films as ed wood , beetlejuice , pee - wee ' s big adventure , and edward scissorhands -- is the creative force behind nightmare . originally , burton authored a poem that became the basis of the storyline , and he was jointly involved in the production design of the film ( though many mistakenly assume he directed the picture ) . the stamp of burton is clearly everywhere in the film -- with bold colors , imaginative character design , and it ' s simple yet compelling story . the direction of harry selick , who also directed james and the giant peach , is strong , offering intimate views of the strange collection of characters . also memorable are the songs in the film , written by former oingo boingo lead singer danny elfman , the next john williams of film composing . the nightmare before christmas is intended for both the kid and adult in everyone . it ' s not just child ' s play for the holidays ; it ' s a movie about how to be truly happy in a tough world , saying that all you need to do is just be exactly who you are , without compromise . what better message is there for christmas ?", "i am a steven seagal fan . i only say this now because \" mufti splenetik \" isn ' t my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things . any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on . seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we ' ll always hear when seagal does his limb - twisting thing ) , rarely a female co - lead in sight ( unless it ' s a real - life model - wife who hasn ' t worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine . not to mention very straightforward plots , generally all - round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather - face himself in that same black outfit he ' s been in since nico doing his \" my hands are sharp , nimble knives \" thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull . in the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest . he ' s also put on quite a lot of weight . small potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain ' t broke , why fix it ? ( more on this disappointed person ' s dashed expectations later ) . as jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past . while he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole . it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can ' t trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that \" glimmer man \" thing . an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole ' s former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons . the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) . it ' s the other changes that disappoint . for example , although there ' s a fair amount of violence in this movie , there ' s also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television ' s \" in living colour . \" wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal ' s bead - adorned and brocade - draped cole , keeping up his \" are you crazy \" part of the dialogue with wasted zest . as campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner ' s eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal ' s wooden comebacks make for painful watching . a cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble . he chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies . again , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual . heck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film . is that a lot to ask of the seague ? too much . seagal ' s best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone . not for seagal , the snappy one - liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think . no kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows . that ' s really how it must have started : like - minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else . we trusted him . we got to know him . now , betrayal . i don ' t know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he ' s going to try to be funny again . i ' ll try , but it won ' t be easy . if you haven ' t watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out . it ' s easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences . after all , if we can ' t depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ? the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice . mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan . everybody makes mistakes once in awhile .", "uncompromising french director robert bresson ' s \" lancelot of the lake \" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory ' s \" morte darthur . \" instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them . chivalry has no place in \" lancelot of the lake , \" except as that of a dying ideal . bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin ' s command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ ' s blood . bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure . the opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house . since the film starts with camelot in near - ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn ' t carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films . we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness . but , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film . rather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom . lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh . the greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur ' s wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot . even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment . he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion . when sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot ' s defense . it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire . bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men ' s hearts and minds . \" lancelot of the lake \" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped - down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music . he uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits . the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film ' s thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest . like most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices . all the actors he used in \" lancelot of the lake \" had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again . never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word . instead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images . in some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it doesn ' t . the final montage of arthur ' s men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap - pile sums up the entire film in one moment . however , other times bresson ' s uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable . for instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses ' legs . he does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag . while there might be symbolic value in this , the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome . nevertheless , \" lancelot of the lake \" is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker . bresson ' s style may not be for everyone , but one has to respect his strength as an artist . by re - evaluating the arthurian legends and making them his own , he turns \" lancelot of the lake \" into something rare in modern cinema : a truly personal film .", "one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction . the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun . sometimes the stories are compelling . sometimes they ' re not . but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i ' ve never been bored by any of the enterprise ' s numerous missions . star trek : insurrection is no exception . the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it ' s the worst in the series ) , but i ' m not really sure why . it ' s an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film . some say it ' s a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film . others say the special effects are cheesy and that it ' s boring . i simply enjoyed the film . insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba ' ku ; the ba ' ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet . of course , these peaceful people can ' t horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son ' a , led by ru ' afo ( f . murray abraham ) , to mess everything up . the son ' a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba ' ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying . that ' s when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba ' ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba ' ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) . so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba ' ku in their natural habitat . when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it ' s not entirely necessary to re - introduce your characters with each episode . this is why i believe non - fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it . insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters . stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together . jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy . frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action . this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son ' a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba ' ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look . if i have any complaint about the film , it ' s that it tries to take a moral stance when it ' s not very appropriate to do so . i don ' t think it ' s that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba ' ku in order to save the lives of thousands . better yet , why couldn ' t they have co - existed ? insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience . with it ' s inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn ' t seem well - equipped to deal with issues like this . i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle .", "seen september 13 , 1998 at 4 p . m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater # 2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony / loews critic ' s pass . [ theater rating : * * 1 / 2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable ] \" rounders \" is exactly the kind of movie parents don ' t want their kids to see . it ' s not that it ' s a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it ' s a film that flat - out says you can make a career out of gambling . and to take make things \" worse \" it proves this through its original , fascinating story . there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the \" noir \" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life . this film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing . matt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20 - something law student in present - day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played . damon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced - over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . mike ' s about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer . but then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly - groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . he never sounds like he ' s reading from a script , nor that he ' s trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys ' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . immediately we get the sense that poker isn ' t for gamblers , but for near - geniuses with nerves of steel . the game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . we learn only a little about mike , both past and present . presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . they go through a few break - up / make - up cycles until mike ' s childhood pal and fellow rounder \" worm \" ( norton ) is released from prison . it ' s not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . technically , the plot isn ' t unlike many children ' s sitcoms in which the \" good \" kid ' s \" bad \" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out - thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he ' s dealt and works with them . sometimes they pay off ( i . e . his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don ' t ( i . e . the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $ 30 , 000 on a single hand ) . once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites ' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything ' s a battle against the cards destiny deals . one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . matt ' s good at gambling but he ' s also got potential to be a great lawyer . he could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there ' s stability but not much risk involved . can someone who ' s gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? if the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker - playing , then the ending is our test . everything is told from mike ' s perspective , but we ' re finally able to recognize some things on our own . this makes the final , against - all - odds showdown seem like just that . it works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof . what separates \" rounders \" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end .", "it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an acquired taste . indeed . while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungee - jumping , they require no less amount of physical stamina and concentration . i felt rewarded at the end of henry fool ; this movie creeps up on you - at a slow 139 minutes , i mean creeps - and despite the final shot ' s ambiguity , i left completely satisfied . henry fool ( \" used to have an ? e ' \" ) arrives at garbageman simon grim ' s house , claims the vacant basement apartment , and almost instantly inspires simon ( urbaniak ) to take up writing - henry ( martin donovan look - alike ryan ) is an ex - convict , a once - great author who has been \" exiled and marginalized \" by the publishing community because of his criminal activity . simon ' s poetry turns him into a local sensation , as it causes mute women to sing , high - school girls to swoon , and councilmen to rile against its \" pornographic \" content . meanwhile , henry seduces both simon ' s dependent mother ( porter ) and immature sister ( sundance queen posey ) with philosophical babble ( which is by turns brilliant and inane ) and breathy animal lust . these story elements result in climaxes both inevitable and unpredictable ; the teacher - student relationship formed between henry and simon eventually reverses itself . henry fool is sprinkled with hartley - ian flourishes : simon drinks milk from \" udderley ' s \" ; the big teen hang - out is called \" world of donuts \" ; simon wears his garbageman ' s uniform throughout ; the editing style is decidedly elliptical . . . ( which is key to the conclusion ' s said ambiguity ) . the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first , self - consciously \" quirky \" ; the introductory scenes are a chore . these people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion , a belief in themselves , and because they have long - term goals ; henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner , but they aren ' t pop slackers . the story is rather classical : the tutor is a better talker than a doer , raised on books ; the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of . ( shades of film school . . . ) the finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small , and the final third does test one ' s patience , yet henry fool is tight , hardly excessive in its length . how refreshing to see a movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character . and unless i nodded off , not a single building exploded . this , hartley ' s seventh feature , is contemplative about \" the artist \" ; fortunately , we never get a sampling of simon ' s work , and it ' s a testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers ' pens .", "it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a . i . artificial intelligence , just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material . for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home , an outcast seeking family , themes very familiar from most of spielberg ' s body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e . t . to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan , naming just a few examples . a . i . is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies . it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances . the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions , and with the number of births limited by the government , many couples are yearning for children . and professor hobby ( william hurt ) has the solution . a robotic boy named david ( haley joel osment ) , who is programmed to love . as a test , david is placed with henry swinton ( sam robards ) and his wife , monica ( frances o ' connor ) . their natural - born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness . the first third of a . i . deals with david ' s life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son , martin . circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons . he is abandoned and alone . david , highly influenced by the fairy tale , pinocchio , feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica ' s love for him . the film ' s second act follows david ' s search for the blue fairy , whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish . during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe ( jude law ) , a robot who specializes in sex . spielberg is at his top form in this sequence , offering a brutal \" flesh fair \" where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers . here , is where kubrick ' s influence is strongly felt , as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots . the savagery conjures up images from the late director ' s a clockwork orange . at about two hours and 30 minutes , the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes , a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters . it is all very anti - climatic and jarring . these scenes seem almost superfluous , as if from a different film . a . i . is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg - 13 rating . it is a story combining hope and intolerance , sacrifice and bigotry , and while it does not coalesce perfectly , the movie does offer some disturbing images . but a . i . is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment . if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination , it is this lad , who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david , a being created for the express purpose of loving . he shines when with monica , beaming with love , as eager as a puppy to please . after being left in the woods , he is confused , lost , hurt , focusing on one objective : to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother ' s eyes . law is pleasant as the care - free robot who really doesn ' t understand david ' s quest , but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey . probably the toughest role is o ' connor ' s monica . playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin , she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance , but as a threat to her family . she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action . many of a . i . ' s futuristic sets are breathtaking , especially a mostly submerged new york , lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps . a . i . is a flawed film , and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering - even subconsciously - how it would have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera . would it have been darker ? more cynical ? we will never know . we can only judge what is before us on the screen , a collaboration of two cinematic giants . a . i . is a most interesting and thought - provoking examination of a future that is quickly gaining on us .", "i have never been so confused after watching a movie . \" meet joe black \" is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year , with a cinematography , music and cast that will dazzle most of us . at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season . at first you marvel at the elegant direction , graceful cinematography and sensual musical score . then you ' ll wait for something to happen for half an hour , but when you finally understand what ' s going on , you ' ll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins , brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this ? the script is simply a silly and unresolved story , which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture . it feels like an eternity . most of the time it is a pompous soap opera , filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and \" meaningful \" winks . the film is based on alberto caesella ' s play \" death takes a holiday \" . the story concentrates around bill ( anthony hopkins ) who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man , but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying \" yes \" . soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen ( brad pitt ) who introduces himself as \" death \" . it is bill ' s time . but death has other plans . it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive . our bill is chosen to be death ' s guide and in exchange he gets time . bill introduces death as joe black , who immediately becomes the center of everyone ' s attention . bill ' s business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill ' s side , lives in his house and resides at his office . that is not all , however . bill ' s youngest daughter susan ( claire forlani ) falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her . this relationship is bound to have some serious consequences . it wouldn ' t be fair to say that this film didn ' t have some interesting moments , such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill ' s family for dinner . when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love , the experience is somewhat different . it is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure . it ' s one thing to say : \" wouldn ' t it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth . . \" to create a motion picture out of this is another . four screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic . it is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film . on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest ( \" scent of a woman \" ) . hopkins looks great in any role , and no matter how shallow or hollow it is , he will complete it . his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else , since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment . but pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time . how can you play death in human form ? to me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters . they are not creatures , but phenomenas . saying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form . handling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work . speaking in a calm , soft voice , portraying death as a lonely , distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters . he looks and acts more like an angel of death , rather than a demon or a red - eyed executioner . claire forlani and others are also fine , stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits . unfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery . in other words this is not what i expected from the director of \" scent of a woman \" . it could ( and should ) be better with such cast and crew . in the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera .", "in present day hanoi , three sisters reflect on their parents ' relationship while trying to define their own in writer / director tran anh hung ' s ( \" the scent of green papaya \" ) \" the vertical ray of the sun . \" youngest sister lien ( tran nu yen -

bin ( \" flowers of shanghai \" ) linger over and repeat the small gestures of everyday life - a wife washes her husbands hands , a woman makes water dance in a bowl , a man pulls his lover to face him before they part . small spaces such as rooms , alleys and courtyards create intimacy . the color green , symbolizing life and tranquility , is used heavily in the film ' s visual styling , lapsing into yellowish hues and blues . writer / director tran anh hung ' s film recalls ang lee ' s \" eat drink man woman , \" another tale of three sisters of varying modernity coming together traditionally for a parent . but while lee ' s more traditionally story - driven film resulted in radical changes for all concerned , \" the vertical ray of the sun ' s \" characters strive for peaceful harmony . watching it is like trailing your fingertips in a stream on a cool spring day .", "there was probably a good reason that the warner bros . studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened . and , after seeing this piece of toxic waste , i now know why . this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago . fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god ' s country , somewhere in eastern kentucky . it ' s beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate ( kris kristopherson , who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role ) . it turns out that he ' s filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit . seagal plays jack taggert , an aikido - versed , fighting machine , who is an agent with the epa . no . . . not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa . it ' s the environmental protection agency . i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers ! taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice . written by someone named jeb , i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships , banjo - picking preachers , and dumb - as - nails rednecks . but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in . seagal ' s idea of a disguise is a long - length $ 1000 leather jacket . but to get closer to the kinfolk , he will fix people ' s porches for free . that ' s another great epa asset - teaching agents how to fix porches . slow and plodding , this project is a total mess . the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige . here , his bravado basically turns into bullyness . townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued . fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever . and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes . the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony , gets behind the pulpit , and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment . but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping , kristopherson , meets up with seagal . kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away . seagal gallantly replies : \" i ' ll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth . \" i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background . this is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal ' s righteousness and narcissistic arrogance . seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace , that of the enviro - thriller ( on deadly ground ) . however , the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this . still , i believe in preserving mother earth , so save your $ 5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity .", "these days , people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run . 1970s nostalgia is already wearing off , and now , people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s . few years in the future , early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia . however , i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period . one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon ' s loaded weapon 1 , that , in many ways , symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry - lack of originality and ideas . being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series , this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) , burn - out alcoholic cop on the edge , and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson ) , by - the - book policeman , days away from retirement . two of them , following the murder of luger ' s ex - partner , must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner ) , crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies . the authors of this films ( whose director , gene quintano , worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy ) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects , and that reflects in the lack plot , characters , and , even original lines . the plot , or what goes for the plot in this movie , is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series , this film \" borrows \" its female lead from basic instinct ) . the best gags , are , same as with many other similar movies , shown in the trailers . the rest simply doesn ' t work . only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh . others would probably wince at the lameness of humour . some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while . but , at the end , spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort . the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones . the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel .", "the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one . it ' s 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash - outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his \" attorney \" dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) . these two spend most of the film in a drug - induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path . duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won . he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference . fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs . it doesn ' t , even in the beginning -- while the pair ' s antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark . director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we ' re laughing , we ' re laughing at them rather than with them . they spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles . the black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it ' s probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first - hand . all this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one - hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off - kilter satire of drug culture . thankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , \" riding the wave \" of something that seemed special and important . now it ' s six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it . materialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the \" american dream \" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever . the social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment . in many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam ' s most reality - based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science - fiction plot elements . yet it is his off - the - wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance . the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke ' s world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations . unlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo . during the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn ' t seem to approve , doesn ' t do anything to stop it either . by the time this scene takes place , they don ' t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . duke seems to realize at some level that he ' s become something he doesn ' t like , but he ' s either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co - writers deserve more credit than that . there ' s plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the ' 60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren ' t usually very pleasant . unlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who ' s given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs . in its own psychedelic , whacked - out way , it ' s sad and regretful , but i think it ' s also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically - induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas - style materialism . indeed , duke himself admits at one point that he ' s never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them . i ' m not sure if he ' s any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea .", "underwater science fiction stays submerged sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents . you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered . psychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash . when he arrives at the site , he discovers that there is no plane , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 , 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years . having written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship . his group as outlined in his report , consists of beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician ; and ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist . unfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow - off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then - colleagues to the team . \" after all , \" he explains , \" who reads government documents ? \" lead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , a top secret federal operative , the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel . once there they stroll over , knock on the door and explore the still - operational ufo . discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere . when adams enters the sphere , the weirdness unfolds . a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer . \" my name is jerry . i am happy \" flashes across the screen . this is unsettling for the psychologist . \" what happens if jerry gets mad ? \" he asks . barnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can ' t put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry . then the situation turns bad . deadly beasts appear from nowhere . a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel . lethal sea snakes attack goodman . a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" . the suspicious scientists turn against each other . this has all the makings of a first - rate thinking man ' s science fiction film . however even the finest ingredients don ' t go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn ' t seem to care about his product . director barry levinson has churned out a mish - mosh that doesn ' t engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes . the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification . it ' s much like speed - reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances . it doesn ' t get any better when the action scenes begin . while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles , the people are still flat . oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them . after adams experiences the interior of the sphere , no one bothers to ask him what happened . their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited . even goodman and halperin ' s ill - conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing . her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing . there ' s a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending , but here they are far too obvious . when an emergency mini - sub is explained , you know what ' s going to happen . the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting . chapter headings that divide the movie have no function . the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos . much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow . although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable , a great deal of it isn ' t . even a science fiction film must be internally consistent . there ' s too much here that doesn ' t make sense . are the manifestations real ? the jellyfish kill queen latifa ( in a throw - away role ) and the squid nearly destroys the outpost , but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect . a scene in the sub suggests that it ' s illusion , but earlier episodes indicate that it ' s not . not everything has to be explained to death , but there are major questions that the film never answers . where the ship came from is clarified , but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to . even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll . the climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale . after pre - release audience testing , the actors were called back to re - shoot the ending . it ' s difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse . following the recent tradition of lengthy films , this weighs in at over two very long hours . the weak scenes could have been cut , but then there wouldn ' t have been much left . the movie was supposedly held up by effects work , but there ' s nothing special on the screen . we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm . stealing from \" alien \" , \" the abyss \" and the disastrous \" event horizon \" , this film has learned nothing from them . remarkably levinson and hoffman ' s other currently showing film is \" wag the dog \" , a smart and entertaining piece of work . this one could have been titled the same sans one word .", "the heartbreak kid ( reviewed on aug . 26th / 1998 ) starring charles grodin , cybill sheppard , eddie albert in \" the heartbreak kid \" , charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters i ' ve seen on screen in a long time . he ' s a guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another . i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film . as the film opens , he has just gotten married , and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon . halfway there , he begins to resent his bride . by the time he arrives at his hotel and has met the cybill sheppard character , he is ready to divorce his wife . as played by grodin , this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him . the phrase \" the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence \" was practically written with him in mind . however , if he finds something he really wants , he will pursue it for as long as it takes . the only problem is , once he has it , he immediately loses interest . the end of \" the heartbreak kid \" is both hilarious and sad for that very reason . charles grodin is at his smarmy best here , and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodin ' s desire . however , the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin , daughter of director elaine may , as grodin ' s whiny bride . she owns every scene that she ' s in , and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do . \" the heartbreak kid \" was written by neil simon and it shows . simon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships , and he ' s at the top of his game here . as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is , he ' s the type of guy that everyone knows . the character of george costanza on \" seinfeld \" seems to have been modelled after him . the only problem with the film is that it ' s not that funny , and it ' s billed as a comedy . as much as i could see the realism in the characters , it would have been nice to have a chuckle here and there . \" the heartbreak kid \" is not a date movie . it has an extremely negative view of relationships , so seeing it with a girlfriend / boyfriend , could be hazardus to your health .", "produced by robert lantos & stephen j . roth directed by douglas williams mpaa : not rated ( though from language , violence , medical - gross - outs , and sexual content , i ' d put it at pg ) though made in canada , \" overdrawn at the memory bank \" traces its roots to the bbc school of film production . using , for the most part , cheap computer and video special effects , chyron text , wildlife documentary footage , and sets that are sometimes obviously faked up , it nonetheless manages to tell a good enough science fiction story that by the time you ' re twenty minutes into it , you should be hooked . raul julia plays aram fingal , a drone data processing worker for novicorp whose active imagination and predilection for hacking gets him into trouble with authority . caught watching \" casablanca \" on his desk monitor , fingal is sentenced to \" doppling \" rehabilitation -- he is to spend forty - eight hours in the body of a baboon . ( how exactly this is supposed to rehabilitate him is anybody ' s guess . ) as it happens , thanks to a visiting schoolboy ' s prank , his body is temporarily misplaced , and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they can find it . as time ticks away before his memory cube self - destructs , the frantic search for his body is on . . . while fingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world , then finds there ' s no better way to hack the system than from the inside . during the chaos , computer technician apollonia james ( linda griffiths ) maintains contact with fingal through a datalink , manifesting several different times to offer advice or warnings . over the course of their interactions , interest on both their parts grows into a budding romance . given that \" casablanca \" is fingal ' s favorite film , and the basis for his fantasy world , a great deal of the movie is homage to \" casablanca \" . in fact , the humphrey bogart and peter lorre characters make appearances ( played by julia in a dual role and louis negin , respectively ) in a bar called \" the place \" . julia ' s portrayal of bogart is passable , and avoids becoming the \" schweethaat \" - spouting parody seen in cartoons . negin ' s peter lorre is quite credible , and easily the best peter lorre i ' ve ever seen who wasn ' t the real thing . the two of them , as characters created by fingal ' s imagination , serve as aspects of his personality , driving him on in his quest to hack the computer system . those aren ' t the only casablanca characters to put in appearances . the sydney greenstreet character also happens to be around . . . as \" the fat man \" , the alternate aspect of the film ' s main villain , the novicorp chairman ( donald c . moore ) . while fingal ' s body is lost , the fat man tries to stop him from hacking the system . . . with less than salutory results . it ' s interesting to note the futuristic slang words that are thrown about left and right during the film , in the best golden - age science fiction tradition . words like \" dopple \" , \" psychist \" , \" computech \" , \" cinema \" , and \" reconst \" are apparently in common use . and while people of today may well laugh at fourteen years past ' s idea of futuristic data processing clerks , some aspects of this film are surprisingly perfectly in keeping with the way we think of \" virtual reality \" today . as cyberpunk films go , this may not be a staple of the genre , but it ' s definitely recommended viewing . the special effects are very primitive , placing this production in the realm of low - to - medium - budget television . the music is completely electronic - synthesized , which fits the low budget but isn ' t really out of keeping with the genre . however , the writing quite makes up for it . there are some very funny moments , and quite a few little in - jokes that one needs to have seen \" casablanca \" to appreciate properly . all in all , i give \" overdrawn at the memory bank \" a .", "\" mercury rising \" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary . that ' s right . the major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better . this central device is the fact that a nine - year - old boy is autistic . his name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it . simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him . the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of \" mercury rising . \" i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon ' s character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost . miko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he ' s touched , and has a hard time looking at other people . it ' s a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn ' t playing like he ' s autistic . unlike dustin hoffman ' s performance in \" rain man \" or leonardo dicaprio ' s in \" what ' s eating gilbert grape , \" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting . however , unlike \" rain man \" which used its character ' s autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , \" mercury rising \" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid . hell , he doesn ' t even have to be shy . in fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis ' arm . willis ' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything . he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon ' s house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide . of course , we know that isn ' t the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square - jawed government hitman with a mean - looking crew - cut knock off the parents . simon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked . jeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon . this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon ' s parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes . late in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop . of all the hard - to - believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst . i can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey ' s character is far too accommodating . not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o ' clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent . the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point . the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here \" mercury rising \" doesn ' t rise to the challenge . the movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including \" sea of love \" ( 1989 ) and \" malice \" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion . there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were . the grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it ' s more suspenseful that way . taken as a whole , \" mercury rising \" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor . usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious . this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts . maybe the book was better , but the way it ' s handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore .", "not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies . like bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters ' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations . also like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters ' ravished and wracked faces . and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman ' s own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film . all that is missing is a discussion of god . which is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master . in fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind . nonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film ' s rhythms . once the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards . one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is . though leigh may have adopted some of bergman ' s stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross - cutting during a married couple ' s strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any \" style \" at all . whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary . the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors . it is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting . much has been made of brenda blethyn ' s performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is . there are a few missteps . for one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film . this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout . and occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced . for all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention . it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film . in fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it . there is even a sweet but significant irony in the film ' s unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe . nonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart . though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen . needless to say , it is also very depressing at times . but for many of us , of course , so is life . and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending , that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better .", "battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 , and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close . in fact , i ' ll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years . based on the novel by scientology guru l . ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information . it ' s the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes . ok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind . when were we conquered ? the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we ' re going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me . . . keep reading ) . also , why don ' t we get to see earth get conquered ? how the hell do you make a popcorn sci - fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ? humans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film ' s first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado . they grunt and groan and babble about monsters . so , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ? none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was ) . this is definitely not the way to start an action / sci - fi film . one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it . the \" monster \" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course . he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them . so , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ? anyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit . the cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something . so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ? and , we ' re supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can ' t even handle a few cavemen ? one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos . so jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ? please , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood . why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ? shouldn ' t they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ? the psychlos refer to humans as \" man animals \" but yet dogs are still \" dogs \" . why aren ' t they \" dog animals \" ? the psychlos are after mining earth ' s precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ? why do i even care at this point ? i ' m a fan of travolta ' s and i ' m glad to see he ' s back on the a -

class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world . ooooo , scary villain . as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better . you can make a dumb but good sci -

his mother doesn ' t seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son , as any mother would , but it still seems inconsiderate of him . i haven ' t read the book , but i ' m sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein ; therefore , i ' m suspicious . another thing that ' s never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title , which , i ' m sure , is also explained in the memoir . if seen as a film onto itself , rather than an adaptation , angela ' s ashes stands tall . despite a few minor setbacks , it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder .", "' lake placid ' is definately not your typical creature attacking people movie , ok so maybe it is , but this one is enjoyable , and clever . actually it comes off more of a comedy than a horror film . well the ending is kinda scary , but in most horror / comedies they are . i will admit that ' lake placid ' isn ' t an oscar worthy film , but it does come off as an inventive movie that is original and funny . bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend is cheating , is forced to go to lake placid and investigate a tooth , after a man is bit in half . she gets there but really doesn ' t understand why she is there . bill pullman plays a man also investigating what happened , along with the sherriff and a rich croc obsessed man , they go out and find what is going on . what they find though isn ' t great . a huge and i mean huge crocodile is living in lake placid , over 150 years old , he has migrated here for who knows why . they have to fight against the croc and try to trap him so they can study him and see where he came from . betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid , and well you ' ll have to see the movie to find out . her character is very funny and foul - mouthed , which is surprising to hear betty spew words and phrases that are pretty bad , but funny . to me the movie came off as a spoof of jaws . with the opening sequence , and some others , it is not original and is . when you watch this movie , you definately notice the smartness and cleverness of it . david e . kelly who is the mastermind of the practice and ally mcbeal , writes this movie with ease and surprisingly does a great job . the characters have smartmouths , two foul , and some great one - liners . but believe me , don ' t take ' lake placid ' too seriously or you won ' t like it . but it is a movie that can be enjoyed as a fun ' popcorn ' type movie . but i guess it rates above the ' popcorn ' rating . sit back , watch the movie , laugh , scream , and whatever you want . even though the movie is r , and i put violence and gore . there ' s really not that much gore , but what there is might seem kinda gross to some . ' lake placid ' is a smart , clever , funny , and scary movie that i enjoyed and i think you will too .", "after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo . their officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo ' s army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba , who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals . with unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country ' s resources , proclaimed secession . lumumba replaced janssens , making mobutu a colonel , and went on a pacification tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) , but it was too late . ' when you want to drown a dog , you say it has rabies , ' prophesies lumumba of his own fate . peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players , although they frequently succumb to cliche , particularly regarding lumumba ' s private life . peck ' s script illuminates bantu sayings like ' the hand that gives , rules ' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador . peck ' s direction is less assured , with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare . he ' s served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role . ebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character ' s fierce passion for his people and his country . lumumba ' s intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he ' s cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney . peck ' s subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production . \" lumumba \" is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney ' s performance makes the tragedy personally felt .", "wesley snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles . murder at 1600 , u . s . marshals , money train , drop zone , boiling point , and the ultimate camp film - passenger 57 . the art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category . ultimately , it is little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the warren report , ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe , and terrible acting by b - list actors like michael biehn and anne archer . oddly , it feels like the undiscovered sequel to another snipes \" masterpiece , \" rising sun . the movie revolves around the convenient story of a special un operative caught up in a secret murder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador , the chinese triad brotherhood , a rich chinese businessman ( played by ? that bad guy from rising sun , cary - hiroyuki tagawa ) a chinese un interpreter , and , inexplicably , donald sutherland . the film ends with more confusion than a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island . or should i say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woo ' s hong kong films combined . i am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers of the film . i usually enjoy snipes ' movies - though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films . simply , i am amazed by the how inane the script was , filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences . director christian duguay ( screamers ) has a strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts -- showing splattering brains , people impaled with broken shards of glass , and lots of gargling and gagging as blood sprays everywhere . it also sickens me to know that oliver stone , one of the greatest directors working today , had his hand in producing this monstrosity . i guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle and stone chose not to read the script , watch the dailies , be involved in casting , or anything else -- or else he ' d be filing a court order to remove his name from the credits . it ' s also seems evident that with the russkies as our new bosom buddies and the middle eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last couple of years that the new international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese . i ' m sure over the next couple of months , even more \" chinese conspiracy / martial - arts action flicks \" are going to be popping up in your local multiplex . hopefully they won ' t include wesley snipes .", "\" psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred \" . a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip - off . but no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento ' s most consistently successful film . what impresses most in re - watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento ' s directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near - fully coherent narrative . screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions . no question : argento has always been a better director than a writer . fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called \" suspiria de profundis \" . the film ' s storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches . jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance . arriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state . what happens next - and i don ' t make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock ' s infamous shower scene in psycho . it ' s quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento ' s own . though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria ' s opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school . we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour - old - matriarch - from - hell roles she does so well . several more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn ' t want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film ' s climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that ' s most impressive . the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about . fortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film . the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region . and the soundtrack ? it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else . as it stands , the use of goblin ' s music in suspiria is outstanding . apparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts . a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer ' s overall experience . even better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you ' ll get the added bonus of widescreen . and the colours ! deep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast . the cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb . a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors . these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento ' s more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked . suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status . the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that ' s always been one of argento ' s shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror .", "if you haven ' t plunked down your hard - earned money yet for \" wild wild west , \" the latest summer holiday offering from will smith , let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck ' s frappacino or on a ben & jerry ' s sundae . these treats are great relief from the summer heat . in contrast , this film made me simmer in disappointment . i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat . this was true of star wars episode i , but at least in that film , the story and the characters were still in the back seat . in this film , they are no where to be found . what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats , lots of female extras who look like can - can dancers , and a clunky , 80 - foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula . two men are asked to stop this threat . one is artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents . among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest . the other man is jim west ( will smith ) , who prefers the shoot - first - then - shoot - some - more method of investigating . although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success , their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate , two - man vaudevillian act . for example , there is a scene where west , being more debonair than the reserved gordon , notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat , which is what it is currently filled with . \" now touch my breast , \" west says . gordon does so and then softly coos his approval . i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness . the script fails to generate any sense of drama , humor , or fun for that matter . i did enjoy kline ' s reserved performance , but was surprised at how much latitude they gave to smith . could it be that will smith is just so bankable that he ' s not even required to act ? it was as if the director was yelling \" will smith , do your own thing . . . and action ! \" here ' s an example . in this scene , will smith is about to be hanged by a group of angry white people . he must endear himself to the crowd to escape . the director yells , \" will smith , do your own thing . . . and action ! \" in another scene , he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades . \" will smith , do your own thing . . . and action ! \" worse still , the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess . there are cogs spinning and pulleys pulling and levers going up and down everywhere you look . there ' s actually a lot of imagination at work in this film . there are some genuinely clever inventions and gizmos introduced , but all of this imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered and dramatically flat . and that ' s too bad because if there was more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his ' thing , ' this film might have been palatable . as it turns out , \" wild wild west \" is the wild , wild worst and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of the year .", "\" the fugitive \" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made . it takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that ' s totally believable throughout . this isn ' t an over - the - top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly . harrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife . the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner . we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble ' s perspective . hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble ' s wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered . we don ' t get to see who the killer is until much further into the story . in fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble ' s innocence ourselves . the film doesn ' t spend much time on the details of kimble ' s trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story . one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck . but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch . this movie is so incredible because it ' s able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable . tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives . from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur . kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other . most of the film deals with richard ' s complex investigation as he tries to find the one - armed man who killed his wife . ford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy ' s script and davis ' s outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is . just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting . we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we . meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down . at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them . he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery . one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor . there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) . they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one - liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner . the final act concludes with another terrific chase . richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved . the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we don ' t realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together . maybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it . we ' re so relieved when justice is served . it ' s not the plot is that makes \" the fugitive \" great , it ' s all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story . watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous . if only hollywood could produce more movies like this .

( oh , how witty . ) she rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer , who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film . cruella then becomes ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists , like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck , and she becomes the evil vixen again . a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat , but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula . at this point , i was envying those kids filing out of the theater . how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu ( as the film ' s villain ) sunk in the film business ? it ' s almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon . and depardieu . . . how can a french guy have a bad french accent ? and never mind the toilet brush haircut . the only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent ( courtesy of eric idle ) that thinks he ' s a rottweiler . now that ' s funny .", "contrary to the title , \" the boxer \" is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics . it ' s actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story . all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story , but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal . we ' ve seen it all before , and we ' re just not blown away with it like we should be . oh well . it ' s still an excellent irish story . \" the boxer \" of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day - lewis ) , an ex - ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over . first off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub - leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail . while this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle ' s \" shallow grave \" ) , re - open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together . danny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again . and danny runs into his ex - love , maggie ( \" breaking the waves \" ' s emily watson ) , who hasn ' t seen him since he went in . they don ' t easily start up their romance again because she ' s the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny ' s tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon . but the two are slowly re - drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things . the political story is nothing really special but works in itself . we ' ve seen it many a time before , but it ' s at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times . there ' s a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty . the boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship . there are only a few boxing scenes , but they ' re never like \" raging bull \" / let ' s - strip - down - the - sport - to - its - bones brilliant . they ' re more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times . and i didn ' t know daniel day - lewis was in such good shape . but the backbone of the story is the love one . because these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight . as the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters . this is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood . these elements are pretty much equally balanced , with each of the parts of the stories working hand - in - hand with eachother . i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered , and sometimes spilled over into the next . it made sure that we didn ' t just care for one of them . i ' m not saying they ' re all equally great , because the love story really carries the film , but at least they all work out respectively . the acting is amazing , with day - lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry . i ' m not sure if they ' re oscar - nominee bound , but they ' re very good . in the supporting roles , billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers . but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike , who is just a great scene stealer . the direction and co - writing by jim sheridan ( with the other co - writing credit going to terry george ) is excellent , rounding out the characters well , but not pacing everything greatly . i noticed that the first half was very leisurely ( yet fascinating ) , but the second half whirls by at a quick pace , and ends much too quickly . more time could have been spent thinking up the ending , since it does seem quite sloppy . though \" the boxer \" is a good film , it never achieves the greatness that it should . sure , it ' s a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get , but on it ' s own , it just could have been better . but it still works out , gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama , and features great acting . even if it could have been better , this ' ll do .", "\" love is the devil \" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist ' s psyche rather than the artist ' s lifeline . watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter . everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film ' s subject , looked at it personally . but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what ' s going on . exactly what was i looking at ? watching this film , i wasn ' t sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous . directed ( and written ) by john maybury , \" love is the devil \" is stylish masterpiece for the senses . everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing . the camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close - ups are uncomfortably too close . the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon ' s world and psyche . as such , there is no real story . i ' ve not heard much about francis bacon that i didn ' t read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like . he was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty . as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he ' s like a foppish and self - absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero . he lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him . it ' s as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( \" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , \" he says one night at the bar he frequents ) . \" love is the devil \" chronicles the latter part of his life . bacon , well - known in his mid - life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor . he walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) . bacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning . george agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason . the film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another . while creating bacon ' s world of friends ( like \" high art , \" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant . bacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn ' t understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings . while watching this , that ' s basically all i thought was there . the film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about . once the film is over , it ' s easier to piece it together . i kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was . someone doesn ' t merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in . thinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother . i thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer ' s head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein ' s \" battleship potemkin \" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain . he drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn ' t for george . i guess that explains the title . a bit . that ' s great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning . i wish it hadn ' t reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) . or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man ' s twisted pysche . it ' s almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man ' s uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience ' s throat . that way you don ' t reduce your film to something it ' s just not . i can ' t say i totally enjoyed \" love is the devil , \" though . despite all of the things i respect about this movie , it ' s still rather uncomfortable to sit through . even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour . though hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man ' s truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it . as such , i respect the way the film looks . it ' s beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with \" what dreams may come \" and \" dark city , \" it ' s the year ' s most visually stunning film . in fact , if a better script had been forged , i ' d almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever . and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs . i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance . then i would have had something to hold me over even now .", "everyone knows that old rule , ' never work with children and animals . ' in this latest horror flick mimic case , it ' s ' never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals ' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience . the film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches . dr . susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the ' judas ' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches . the bug does it ' s job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone . ' three years later ' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill . the spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it ' s predator , and in this case . . . . it ' s humans . that should teach us for squishing all those bugs . what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace . perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the ' predator ' type movie it could easily have become . if it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest . the director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie . there are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking . if the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it ' s sadly babbling nonsense . in fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them . there is some action in this film , but it ' s directed in such an annoying way , it ' s just infuriating to watch . the camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them . the peformances are o . k , if slightly below average . sorvino is o . k , although she ' s not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really . the supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican ' old timer ' ever . their reasonable good fun , however . mimic , then , may fail with it ' s story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good . like dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content . it may be a bit too gloomy for it ' s own good , but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well . but looks aren ' t good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it shouldn ' t really belong . a good opportunity , then , wasted . a shame . overall rating = review by david wilcock ? 1998", "in these days of overlong movies ( meet joe black , the thin red line , the mask of zorro ) it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can ' t be longer than a paltry 90 minutes . this is just a cute movie , even through its mildly risque subject matter . old friends jackie ( bannen ) and michael ( kelley ) try to find the lottery winner ( they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 ) so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings . through process of elimination , they find that it must be lovable old ned devine , who they find sitting in front of his tv , clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand . what results is thuroughly amusing , as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong , and that they could really benefit . after all , old ned won ' t miss it . rather than divulge the later twists and turns , i ' ll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage . bannen and kelly are a perfect pair . one slightly stout , the other as thin as a rail . both getting on in years , they make such a cute pair of old codgers . waking ned devine may even be seen as a \" full monty \" for the geriatric set , especially since kelly gets buff - o for one amusing scene . waking ned devine is by no means perfect , but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films . the performances by everyone in the town are great , particularly the two leads . there is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary , but it hardly ruins the picture . writer / director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters . scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm , not the exception . perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more . had i held off on my year ' s best / worst list for another day , waking ned devine ( officially released in late november of 98 ) surely would have graced the short group of the year ' s finest films . it is light , but thought provoking and sweet . i can ' t think of anyone who shouldn ' t see ( or wouldn ' t enjoy ) this film .", "for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them . sadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two - hour long episode of magyuver . and not a particularly good one at that . what went wrong ? mi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it ' ll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise ' s firing gun just so they can die really cool . early on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff - hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic . in one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi - stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other ' s eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff . prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another . why ? i haven ' t the foggiest . i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply . with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects . it ' s possible that these \" spies \" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored . the scenes i ' ve described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character . god forbid . woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial - like visuals . still in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish . cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) . between the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact . the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us . sure it ' s all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product . thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that ' s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \\ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight . they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres . newton bats her eyes flirtatiously . cruise grins a little too slyly . the cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film . here cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 . he ' s cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90 ' s ) . sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise ' s initial \" i ' m the man ! \" charm and more slo - mo close - ups of his preening mug . mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won ' t stop . the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could ' ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the \" symbolic \" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) . we ' ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand . it isn ' t done any differently here . the action is pure hard target \\ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind . he ' s cool for sure but he ' s made to be as empty as the movie . the actor isn ' t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one . when he ' s not beaming away , he ' s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo ' s editing seriously undermines the effort . he fetishizes cruise ' s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof . i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he ' s really austin powers . in a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin - up boy angel of death . the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) . the lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles . though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano - e - mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a \" so you thought i was dead . . . \" . not to worry , cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat . what a hero ! you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2 ' s plot . my reasoning is simple : i ' m not sure of any good it would do . the film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next \" special \" effect . i wasn ' t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video . nobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they ' ll surely regret it . as summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing . in mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma ' s ( that film ' s director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo ' s non - stop masturbatory pandemonium . it ' s irrelevant in every sense , as is character . all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors .", "in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy - action film genre with the cross - cultural \" rush hour \" - to the tune of about $ 250 million . you don ' t mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in \" rush hour 2 . \" the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non - stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in \" rush hour \" that played well to audiences around the world . the formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable . i ' m never thrilled with the idea of a follow - up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations . surprisingly , \" rush hour 2 \" wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it . the script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start . terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime . concurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r & r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights . instead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars . the makers of \" rush hour 2 \" are working at a distinct advantage over the original . we , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already - existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around . that chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit . little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in \" rush hour . \" first and foremost to me , in \" rh2 , \" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan ' s artistry in fight choreography . the 47 - year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint . chan ' s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket . his moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino . like harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch . chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys . when he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun . when lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff . the comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills . the combo of chan ' s flying feet and fists with tucker ' s fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the \" lethal weapon \" films . the supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently . john lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance ) . lone doesn ' t chew scenery or make pronouncements to \" get lee and carter , \" but gives the chief bad guy elegance . zhang zi - yi ( \" crouching tiger , hidden dragon \" ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky ' s taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter . ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one - on - one melee at the conclusion . ) roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina - she doesn ' t add much to the equation but is terrific to watch . director ratner and the original \" rush hour \" production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera . cinematographer matthew f . leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives \" rh2 \" the fluid camera movement the genre film needs . production design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look , whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino . the rest of the techs are of the same high quality . i ' m surprised to even say that \" rush hour 2 \" is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies . it takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun , frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out , so far , this summer . i give it a b .", "boy , what a great movie ! ! keanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together , the director of the fugitive ( andrew davis ) back again to give us another thriller , and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot . how could this not be a blockbuster ? all die - hard keanu reeves fans , read on . ol \" much ado about nothing \" plays eddie kasalivich , a machinist studying at the university of chicago . to help pay for the rent , he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university . by happy coincidence , he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics . this project holds great promise : taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in . a potential solution to the earth ' s energy problems without the pollution cost . surely nobody could have any problems with that ? morgan freeman is paul shannon , the project ' s sponsor . he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public . he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly . so he murders the project leader , blows up the project ( great but short scene here , sort of like a mini id4 city - devastation thing ) and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi - tech hush - hush location . unfortunately , our intrepid machinist and an english physicist ( weisz ) manage to get away and now follows a fugitive - like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script . this movie is just dying for a comparison with \" the fugitive \" . both movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn ' t change much , i guess we can ' t really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere . the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones , chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward . credit to them , but we aren ' t really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters . where ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy , eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves ' character is never given the time to develop . it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences , which frankly , get quite boring after a while . harrison ford was \" the man against the world . \" he was alone in a world where he didn ' t know who to trust and it came across real well . in chain reaction , keanu reeves isn ' t alone . now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia , vulnerability and confusion . we don ' t get this . we get him thinking he ' s still in speed , only now our sandra bullock has an english accent , probably doesn ' t drive a bus , and hardly contributes anything to the movie . the producers here probably thought , \" hey , what if keanu and rachel don ' t hit it off too well ? let ' s rope in that morgan to help us out . \" well , keanu and rachel didn ' t hit it off well on the screen , and most unfortunately , morgan freeman doesn ' t help much either . the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder . it ' s not really his fault . once again , andrew davis just doesn ' t take the time to build his characters . someone must have convinced him that this time round , cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken . the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice .", "seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater # 6 , by myself for free using my sony / loews critic ' s pass . [ theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture ] war is a topic that can ' t help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media . movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory . it ' s easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other . forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh - and - blood person and not just a number . \" saving private ryan \" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery . it proves there ' s a huge difference between battling and killing . the film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory . it ' s world war ii , d - day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them . spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality . instead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared . there is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops . \" poor \" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are . there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters . we don ' t get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding . the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they ' re there . in the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn ' t happen . the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies . they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well - secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they ' re shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off . perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme . the film seems to rely on the audience ' s sense of patriotism , that the american military is \" right \" and good and that the nazis are \" inherently evil . \" the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50 - foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage . i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn ' t help but feel some sense of joy and relief . to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there ' s nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened . one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting . the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet . tom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon . he ' s never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this . he doesn ' t want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out . the mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan . through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general ' s attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each ' s death simultaneously . when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother . it ' s easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once . but finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , \" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . \" the saving of private ryan isn ' t just a dramatic device , but a thematic one . his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had . when miller ' s company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn ' t so quick to shrug it off . he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone ' s sense of hope a reality . the mission to find ryan gives miller ' s group a destination , but not direction . along the way many things happen to them , both good and bad . a few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice . the act of killing itself becomes one of the film ' s major philosophical metaphors . the soldiers don ' t mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses . unfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn ' t want us to think these men are invincible . in fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work . although the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time . whether they ' re arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable . sure , there ' s a zinger here and there , but war doesn ' t change the fact boys will be boys . if and when one dies we too can feel the loss , even though we hardly knew them . the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous , violent battle sequence . private ryan has been found , but facing four to one odds , can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ? that ' s not a premise for thrills , it ' s symbolic of everything the film has worked for . it would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending , it ends the way it must end . i remember reading a \" calvin & hobbes \" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like , \" dad , how do armies of men killing each other solve problems ? \" \" saving private ryan \" is the adult version of that question .", "a number of critics have decided that it ' s open season on freddie prize jr . , slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound - alike , disposable teen fluff like \" head over heels , \" \" boys and girls , \" \" down to you \" and \" she ' s all that . \" while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend , his talent is not . i first saw him in the independent dark comedy \" the house of yes , \" where he gave a subtle , impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america ' s freakiest families . prinze has the acting chops ; he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown - up movies to show the non - believers that he has what it takes . \" summer catch \" certainly won ' t help his case . inoffensive , but utterly generic , the baseball - related romantic comedy does little more than kill time . the story deals with the love affair between tenley ( jessica biel ) , a wealthy cape cod girl and ryan ( prinze ) , a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becoming a big - time baseball star . ryan ' s preoccupation with his new honey - bunny drives her elitist father ( bruce davison ) crazy and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team . it ' s a wonder the kid has any time to pitch , as his time is occupied with making out with tenley , fighting with her dad , bonding with his own dad ( fred ward , who deserves better than this ) , fighting with his brother ( jason gedrick ) and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates . the filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky , character - heavy baseball movie like \" bull durham , \" but haven ' t got a clue how to get there . and so they glide from one clich ? to the next for 108 minutes . the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a center - fielder from texas . in an early barroom scene , blucas , best known as demon - fighting riley finn from \" buffy the vampire slayer , \" hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass , then turns to teammate matthew lillard and states , \" he does have a nice ass . a bubble butt . \" when lillard gives him an \" are you insane ? \" look , blucas calmly says , \" it ' s nothing sexual , \" then goes on to evaluate the hind - ends of some other players , including lillard ' s . speaking of asses , prinze does not bare his in the movie . the actor has a no nudity clause in his contract , so two stunt - butts were employed for a couple of semi - nude shots . blucas , whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story , gets another unique moment late in the film . sick of hearing teammates make \" fat chick \" jokes , he climbs on top of a table and loudly declares his love of amply - sized ladies . while his speech still ends up objectifying women , it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie . trivial tidbit : \" summer catch \" marks a scooby doo summit . marc blucas appears in \" jay and silent bob strike back \" as fred from the scooby doo gang , while freddie prinze jr . plays the same character in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon .", "the classic story & the production which ruined it marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h . g . wells classic , new line cinema , armed with a stellar cast and expert make - up effects man stan winston ( alien , predator , terminator etc ) churns out yet another hollywood film based on the classic novel . of course , the production is no doubt much more superior compared to the earlier 2 movies , one of which was made back in the 1933 and the other in the 1977 , under the title the island of lost souls ( sounds like a much better title . . ) . the story begins with edward douglas ( thewlis ) , a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific , who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery ( kilmer ) after his plane crashes into the sea . douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr . moreau , who incidently , owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize . his host ' s reluctance to allow him to freely move around the island becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau ' s lab , when a monstrous birth was in progress . even worse , the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal \" people . \" douglas stumbles across yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast - people community , which considers dr . moreau their maker . using shock - therapy and the law , dr . moreau has long been able to keep his beast - people civilised to some extent but there are a few animal - men who are just too savage to be controlled . the island of dr . moreau questions the ability of men playing god . dr . moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings which is free from hate and violence . . . but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long . moreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp . even so , the production has failed to make the most out of it . there are too many characters to put your attention to and the worst thing is , the characters are not \" prioritized \" so when the audience is led to believe that a particular character is important , before they know it , he or she or it perishes . . . . rather ungloriously at times too . perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people , especially aissa ( balk ) , the most human of moreau ' s creations . the two very important characters , montgomery and dr . moreau himself receive no development at all and it is in this area that the script fails miserably . more screen time could have been used for character interaction and development . i really would have liked it better if , say , they delved more into dr . moreau ' s obsession , montgomery ' s purpose in the story and justification to as why the beast - people had to rebel . maybe the nature of the screenplay , which incidently , does not incorporate much action sequences in the film , forced the filmmakers to \" cut a long story short \" and make it more of an action film than anything else ( it ' s still summer , and movies have to be \" marketable \" ) . the special effects too , are really nothing for anyone to shout about . at most , i would say the beast - men looked just a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of the apes . this h . g . wells classic really has potential to be a good film . unfortunately , after 2 adaptations , they still could not decide on how and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that important message which makes up the entire essence of the story . as a third outing , the island of dr . moreau accomplishes little and is nothing more than an inferior version of ` the planet of the apes ' . the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! * * * pretty good , bring a friend . * * * * amazing , potent stuff . * * * * * perfection . see it twice .", "meet joe black is your classic boy -

of - place , but the overly formal technique used by pitt begins to distract from the role . still , he is able to hold his own , and over the course of the three hours , his character begins to grow on you . the main character who seems out of place here is drew ( jake weber ) , an ambitious executive in williams ' company who is joe black ' s main rival for susan ' s affections . weber plays the character with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash . this cartoonish foil an aberration in a film filled many more dimensional characters . the supernatural elements of the film are handled murkily , but never distractingly so . we never learn what is the exact nature of death , or why he ' s never done something like this before . it actually gets a bit creepy when death talks to the dying in their own voices / accents . ( his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter . . . ) and the ultimate resolution to one of the film ' s supernatural problems seems , well , somewhat superficial . still , even with the film ' s length , it was a pleasant time at the movies , something you wouldn ' t necessarily expect from a film about death . . . but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow .", "apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) . director ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 . being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us $ 150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet . perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . . all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles . apollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) . jim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon . suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . . if they ever reach it . ed harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly . audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space . also , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 . the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film - music maestro james horner . watch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film . a bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script . those who consider themselves ` scientifically illiterate ' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show . this is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film . you should enjoy it .", "capsule : john the baptist is sent from heaven to see is the world is worth saving . he must find some sign of hope in the people of newfoundland . this is little more than a tv skit in movie form . it is watchable and apparently will be released to theaters in canada , but it is unlikely to be seen on the international market . it is diverting but hardly a serious piece of cinema . , 0 ( -

telling of the jesse james legend , courtesy of b - movie king james g . robinson ( producer of such classics as wrongfully accused and chill factor ) . delayed since the spring , this version stars the irish hunka hunka burning love colin farrell ( the best part of schumacher ' s tigerland ) as the bad - ass jesse james . alas , any sense of his character has been left on the ranch , leaving us with only cute chicks like ali larter ( minus the whipped cream ) to watch . the spin this time around : fresh from serving as southern militiamen in the civil war , jesse james ( farrell ) , his brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , and his pal cole younger ( scott caan ) lay down their arms and head home to missouri to tend the family farms after the war has ended . but trouble is brewing in their small town of liberty when evil railroad baron thaddeus rains ( harris yulin ) and his cronies rollin parker ( terry o ' quinn ) and allan pinkerton ( timothy dalton ) demand the boys turn over their lands to the railroads . the jameses and the youngers then join forces to fight the railroad -- by robbing banks up and down missouri , thus cutting off the railroad ' s financial surplus and playing robin hood to the local people . along the way , the boys squabble over who ' s the cutest of the gang , who ' s the most popular cowboy in the gang , and who ought to go on mtv ' s total request live . they rob numerous banks with identical interiors , always with the kindest of hearts , strutting in their grungy dusters as moby songs play in the background . the witty banter they share could be plastered within a hallmark card . the biggest disappointment here lies in the acting of colin farrell . after a great job in tigerland , farrell walks through this role easier then nicolas cage in gone in 60 seconds . and his american accent rivals richard gere ' s irish accent in the jackal . combined with feeling like bonanza : the teen years , this homogenized production ( toned down to get the ever - popular pg - 13 rating ) gives us an invincible jesse james that quickly grows tiresome and boring . the unbearable villains courtesy of timothy dalton and thaddeus rains spend the entire film proclaiming that everyone should be hanged , sucking out any energy left in the film . not to mention : the real story of jesse james and his gang bears no resemblance to the plot of american outlaws . instead , the movie is full of old , outrageous tales about the wild west -- tales which went out of style in 5 -

making he mastered the simple comedy . from there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles . some of these work better than others . zelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist . deconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back . harry block ( allen ) has in his life only two drives . he wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing . the story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments . perhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harry ' s life by editing harry ' s scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out . as a writer , harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises . the film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harry ' s books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harry ' s life . these fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion , but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters . it is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person . if that sounds complicated , it is . then as another device in one of the stories , an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image . harry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time . as if these touches did not create sufficient confusion , the story is told out of chronological order . if allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding , any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable . but allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand . deconstructing harry is set at a time when harry ' s old college , the one that expelled him when he attended it , wants now to honor him for a lifetime of writing achievement . harry is searching among his friends to find one who will go with him . just why someone who is so unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear . harry tries his current girl friend fay ( elizabeth shue ) only to find that she is about to marry harry ' s old friend larry ( billy crystal ) . block would like his son hilly ( eric lloyd ) to accompany him , but hilly ' s mother , previously first harry ' s psychiatrist and more recently his wife , refuses to let her son see his father . another friend richard ( bob balaban ) would go but has health problems . harry also considers bringing a prostitute cookie ( hazel goodman ) . it is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite , but cookie is considerably different -- black and a lot brighter than mira sorvino ' s character in the previous film . while the comedy sequences are never complete , a few are elaborate and some quite funny . the centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell with allen playing a sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil , who looks a lot like larry . that story also is left uncompleted , perhaps to show harry ' s unwillingness to commit even to telling a story . the linchpin that was needed to tie together the stylistic quirks of this film was a central character who changes and who gives us something about which to care . that character is patently not the one allen creates in harry block and not the characters around harry as seen through his acerbic eyes . allen can do much better than deconstructing harry . i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -

consideration . this brings us to the dull performance of baldwin . let ' s face it , trying to match matthew mcconaughey ' s wonderful acting in a time to kill is basically impossible . and baldwin is living proof of this , as no emotions could be felt . it seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed a single tear . either poor acting or poor directing , but something definitely went wrong . another strange mishap was the fact that goldberg ' s facial features didn ' t change , as she looked the same in the courtroom as she did holding her husband ' s dead body 25 - years earlier . yet woods ' was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldberg ' s father . at least the make - up was realistic . with some emotional moments in the poorly written script , ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart , when its predecessor , a time to kill , brought tears to everyone ' s eyes . don ' t get me wrong , the movie wasn ' t all that bad , but if you ' ve seen grisham ' s masterpiece , then don ' t expect this one to be an excellent film . ,", "gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a change of heart by the film ' s end and becomes a believer in god instead of a skeptic , going through an amazing transformation by having a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who can now beat the devil by his faith alone . . . this is after two hours of throwing people out windows and shooting more people than your average serial killer . nobody can save this bomb from it ' s own stupidity and arrogance in filmmaking and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious - type of film . it ' s just a pile of dreck . . . an ill - conceived exploitive project , a pyrotechnical film . \" end of days \" aims to be an apocalyptic thriller . it features an idiotic script , a hack director , and a one - dimensional star who is past his prime . . . which makes this film dumber than dumb , plus it ' s not funny , not campy , or is it in the least bit entertaining . it ' s just dreary and unwatchable . . . a big - budget slasher film . arnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan ( occupying gabriel byrne ' s body and possessing a wall st . bank account ) from destroying the world . the film opens in vatican city , roma 1979 -- where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso , looking out at the night sky and seeing a comet whiz by , who proclaims after looking at his scrolls -- that ' s the sign for the ' eye of god , ' which reveals that a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan ' s baby ( the anti - christ ) in the hour before the new century begins , when satan will fuck her and open up the gates to hell on earth . tomaso has some twenty years to find this woman and save her and the world from doom . but some in the pope ' s circle want to kill her if found , even though the pope insists on having faith and letting her live , as he lectures them : \" even in the world ' s darkest days -- doing evil doesn ' t stop evil , but brings on more evil . \" we saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979 , which seems to be the ' logical ' place to look for satan according to the astrology charts of the visionaries . the chosen woman is christine york ( robin ) . it is now a few days before the new year celebration for 2000 and arnold and his wise - cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall street turd , and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest , thomas aquinas , arnold saves him and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot . he , nevertheless , can speak and tells arnold an ' end of days ' is coming as prophesized in revelations . but satan gets to him in his hospital room and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of ' the end of the world ' on his body . it is now up to arnold to save the world and find the chosen woman . he quickly finds christine and does everything to protect her from all the evil forces around her , as the film includes ludicrous helicopter rescues , people jumping out of windows , satan taking a piss and dropping a match to kill arnold ' s partner as the piss explodes like gasoline , satan being fired at . . . resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain and sometimes nothing , as if the director forgot which way he wants to have it . there is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs -- including the subway , churches , and luxury buildings . the only trouble with all these high - budget action sequences , was that it lacked purpose and even entertainment value . the story was so terrible and inaccurate , that it did not have an iota of value or credibility . mercifully the movie drags to a final confrontation in times square , trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown toward the year 2000 . why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil ' s number \" 666 , '' well ! . . . satan ' s numeral is actually \" 999 , '' which is upside down of \" 666 . '' accordingly , you just put a \" 1 '' in front of it -- and bingo -- you get \" 1999 . '' with logic like that , this film might even think it pulled the wool over the viewer ' s eyes and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult . this film should become a classic used by film schools in how not to make a horror film . i highly recommend seeing it for that purpose .", "some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese ' s raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the ' 80s . since there are still a number of ' 80s films that i haven ' t seen , i don ' t feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i ' ll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level . bio - pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero - worship or a dry , dull textbook account . it ' s rare that a movie with the moniker \" based on the life of ? \" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining . raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre . the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the ' 40s and ' 50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen . for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying . historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion ' s share of the details culled from la motta ' s own autobiography ( which was co - written with joseph carter and peter savage ) . however , although la motta is credited as the movie ' s \" consultant , \" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout . the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage . sex and violence are inextricably linked . the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull . in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them . outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled . the two people who spar with him on life ' s canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother / manager , joey ( joe pesci ) . these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses . he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence . raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up - and - coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class . over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch - rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match . meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15 - year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife . vicki becomes jake ' s greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain . his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him . hence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother . ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : \" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? \" ) in the late ' 40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall . he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing . two years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray . by the late ' 50s and early ' 60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine . raging bull is the other side of rocky . sylvester stallone ' s tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 . it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production . but , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring . while scorsese ' s primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working . rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased . there ' s little i can say here that hasn ' t already said about de niro ' s performance . in a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding . the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering . and , although there ' s a lot of travis bickle ( de niro ' s character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him . this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting . as the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit . as the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form . how many actors would go that far ? the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance . cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) . their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro ' s . pesci , who has basically re - created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother . the misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed . but , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it ' s startling to behold . moriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake . later , she ' s called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear . scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black - and - white ( a few \" home movie \" segments are in color ) . the choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black - and - white approach is almost unheard of . ( one important recent exception , schindler ' s list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . ) in black - and - white ( especially considering scorsese ' s choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing . there ' s no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas . during fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point - of - view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta ' s perspective . scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta ' s loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown . after that , his career was all downhill . yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta ' s future . the reason is obvious : scorsese isn ' t as interested in boxing as he is in the character . following his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies . we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self . who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando ' s speech from on the waterfront ? ( \" i coulda been a contenda . \" ) perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the ' 80s . and , if not , it ' s certainly perilously close to the zenith .", "it ' s a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise . the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying . osmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there ' s something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt . not that there ' s anything wrong with scatology . i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was . it ' s merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable . you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn . osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho . the trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen - age audience may find it too tame for their tastes . adults ? well , let ' s just say most will find it unappetizing . osmosis jones plays like a 100 - minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby . the live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe . he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower . frank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast - food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you . he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does . frank ' s body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard - boiled egg that had fallen to the ground . it ' s not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth . nope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate ' s mouth . like i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one . after ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences . here , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier ' s david hyde pierce ) , a 12 - hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) . basically , what we have is a cliched cop - buddy movie , rife with all the clich ? s of that genre . and this is why osmosis jones doesn ' t click . it merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations . the jokes and puns are lame : osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus . after pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , \" funny , he doesn ' t look fluish . \" and the jokes don ' t rise above that level . the live action scenes are no better . frank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child . he ' s almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters . osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left . the animation is rather two - dimensional and flat . it lacks scope and depth . it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head , and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater .", "synopsis : upper middle class , suburban family man lester ( kevin spacey ) realizes that he is just going through the motions : he is unable to feel passion ; he is soulless , cynical , and no longer able to feel the edge between success and failure . everyone else around him has similar symptoms . lester ' s unassertive daughter jane ( thora birch ) is too lethargic to change her world , yet all too ready to whine and complain . his wife carolyn ( annette bening ) is reduced to keeping up appearances and reciting commercialist slogans . and these are people with a big house and a decent standard of living . the only person who seems able to appreciate beauty and freedom and life is the person most deprived of it : a dope - dealing teen from across the street who is practically imprisoned by a domineering , bullying father . when lester embarks on a mad scramble to feel the edge again , the fact that he has quit his job to feel what it ' s like - - and his newfound interest in exercise to impress a teenage girl - - ruffle a lot of feathers in the family . will lester regain his ability to appreciate life ? opinion : people say it all the time : you never appreciate good health until it ' s gone . likewise , people raised in fabulously pampered prosperity can become unhappy and spiteful over the dumbest , most inconsequential problems , simply because they have no clue how good they have it . sometimes it takes a near fall - - accidentally or through deliberate fasting - - to move out of apathy and reclaim your ability to challenge the world . the deprivation / appreciation cycle is a major theme of american beauty . american beauty is a non - formula , intelligent and articulate movie that offers fantastic performances by everyone in the cast , especially kevin spacey , who is simply gosh darn amazing this movie . the thing i like about american beauty is that there is no sentimental music , no hospital scene nor any overly dramatic hokum . the movie entertains and offers brilliant performances just as is . if you are in the mood for a thoughtful , non - formula flick , i highly recommend american beauty .", "upon taking a seat at the theater , and surveying the crowd , i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises . i ' m twenty - two , but have been accused of looking sixteen . yet as the film began , any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close - knit , yet troubled sisters . director pat o ' connor ( inventing the abbots , circle of friends ) weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss , need , and the bonds between five sisters . the family is ruled by kate ( meryl streep ) , an unconsciously strict schoolteacher , who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family . there is very little background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tense but loving home . squabbles take place one after the other , caused by years and years of history . perhaps one of the best things about this film , is its naturalness . no situation is over - wrought , and characters react as real people do , to real problems . this probably is a result of the film being from a stage play . the play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright . what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples , both in lughnasa and africa . in fact , dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness . legs tap , and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster . only after the music stops , and the characters stand breathing heavily do we sense any trouble . in the quiet after the music we muse that it ' s sad that music has to cease , and families falter . the movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy , the narrator of the movie , as a young child flying a kite . he trips over a bump and loses hold of his string , and the kite floats off farther into the distance . drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained , and at another glance mischievous . the mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite , and kate ' s hold of the family isn ' t strong enough to hold off the winds of change . as michael stands , staring at his kite fly away , we hear the adult michael , looking back at the season that his world changed forever . the movie is not overpowering , but it gives us a beautiful window into the life , love , and trouble of a household of lonely women . note : this is the first movie review i ' ve ever written , any responses on it would be greatly appreciated . : )", "you know something , christmas is not about presents . it ' s about over - hyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie - ins . at least that would seem to be the message of \" the grinch , \" which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores . hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season . you know the plot : there ' s this evil furry green guy called the grinch ( jim carrey ) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville . down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation , but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas . the movie is , of course , a live - action version of the beloved children ' s book , which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones . it ' s rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty - year - old half - hour cartoon , but that ' s the case when jones ' version is compared to ron howard ' s . the tv grinch hit all the right notes : boris karloff ' s soft , deep narration ; thurl ravenscroft singing \" mr . grinch \" ; max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head ; and the grinch ' s wide , toothless grin . by contrast , the movie hits one sour note after another . first , there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105 - minute movie . young wide - eyed cindy lou who ( taylor momsen ) is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents ( bill irwin and molly shannon ) during the holiday season . she begins to sympathize with the grinch , who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic . cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class , martha may whovier ( played as an adult by christine baranski ) . are we expected to like the grinch , hate the whos , and want him to steal christmas ? the grinch isn ' t even the villain here ; that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville ( jeffrey tambor ) who was the grinch ' s rival for martha ' s affection . not only are the characters needlessly complex , but the once - simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought . the casting choices aren ' t any better than the screenwriting decisions . jim carrey seems woefully miscast . while his face is so supple that the rubber make - up seems superfluous , carrey brings nothing else to the role . his accent keeps changing ; i assume he was shooting for karloff , but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon , sean connery , and cartman from \" south park . \" not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinch ' s home , carrey falls back on his stand - up comedy and clowns around ace ventura - style . needless to say , his wise - cracking antics don ' t quite fit the character of the grinch , who is an embittered loner filled with hate . little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile . she would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story ( finding \" santa \" in her living room stealing the tree ) . however , the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch , and momsen is not up to the challenge . bottom line : when you ' re stealing christmas ( movies ) , leave this one behind .", "warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film \" fail - safe . \" if you haven ' t seen the film yet , proceed with caution . nutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama . still powerful today , even after the end of the cold war . -------------------- \" fail - safe \" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet review by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn ' t have a winning side and a losing side . in a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world -- assuming the world survives . the idea -- and perhaps the only real option -- is to avoid war at all costs . this is the theme of sidney lumet ' s \" fail - safe , \" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler . \" fail - safe \" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism . the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws . five u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america . the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers . suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike . a great deal of \" fail - safe \" ' s plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia ' s borders -- at any cost . the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios . the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails . general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless -- the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre - programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no - win situation winnable . the events in \" fail - safe \" are fascinating because they ' re anything but predictable , but the real reason \" fail - safe \" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot . a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states ' role in all of it . most of this is through the film ' s use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president ' s advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war . many of the film ' s most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices . early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of \" strategy \" in a nuclear assault to \" minimize \" casualties . \" what ' s the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? \" a guest asks impatiently . \" forty million , \" groeteschele responds wryly . the problem with groeteschele ' s mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o ' herlihy ) has often recommended . on the contrary -- according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . \" fail - safe \" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? is it wise ? is it even logical ? no , not really . although \" fail - safe \" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one - sided sort of way . again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film ' s most important character in terms of the larger - theme significance . in addition to providing the central \" pro - nuclear war \" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . one of groeteschele ' s \" logical \" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it ' s merely absurd . he labels the average marxist an \" unfeeling , calculating machine \" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter - measures that would further destroy russia ' s home soil -- which must be preserved at all costs . groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge -- as any normal person would . the irony here is groeteschele ' s own mechanical theorizing . he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn ' t even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . once the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . just how will the soviet union ' s leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) with the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet ' s long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . without getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear \" incident \" can probably be . ) it does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all - out war , something that simply isn ' t possible because of its all - too - real consequences . dramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o ' herlihy ' s character as the symbolic \" matador \" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film ' s opening ) , is particularly appropriate . \" fail - safe \" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high - tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . nevertheless , under lumet ' s direction and walter bernstein ' s intelligent adaptation of burdick ' s and wheeler ' s novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded . the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . but it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that \" fail - safe \" also finds dangerous . in retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . it ' s just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele ' s dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown .", "if he doesn = 92t watch out , mel gibson is in danger of being known as someone other than mad max . of course there are still a few big guns in this film , but there = 92s some accomplished acting too . although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti -

nosed business negotiations , the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive , he has to play his hand differently . the casting is what puts this film over the top . the trio of gibson , the kidnappers ' mastermind ( gary sinise ) and fbi team leader ( delroy lindo ) play off of each other wonderfully . sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark . his speech to mullen over a walkie talkie about h . g . wells = 92 morlocks and eloi reveal his vision of = society . mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes dwell below , feeding off the unsuspecting . gibson = 92s character is an all - american hero with a few flaws . his cowboy = tactics tend to work , but they are also what got him into this situation to begin with . in a round about way , if he weren = 92t known as a man who i = s willing to buy his way out of trouble , his son wouldn = 92t have been kidnapped . as sinise says \" you = 92re a payer . you did it once and now you = 92re going to do it again . \" one of the nicest elements of this film is that most of the characters actually have personalities . lindo calls home to talk to his kids , obviously shaken at working this case . even the kidnappers are real people , arguing about the ultimate fate of sean mullen and feeding him candy bars . gibson = 92s break - down on the balcony of their penthouse apartment is especially effective . it = 92s one of the best filmed representations of a man = 92s world falling apart that i = 92ve seen . it = 92s not all perfect . the shoot ' em upending , while emotionally satisfying seems tacked on to be just that rather than to provide a powerful resolution . as well crafted as the scene is , we = 92ve seen it before . mullen = 92s wife ( rene russo ) has several good moments , but occasionally just seems to be there . while adequate , brawley nolte ( sean ) doesn = 92t provide much to the film other than occupying space to build the story around . but you = 92ll ignore these problems as each minute of the movie builds on the previous one . forget about the large coke , you won = 92t want to leave for that five minute break an hour later .", "one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself . such was the case with boxing helena , 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch , daughter of the great david lynch . made in the dying years of post - twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs , it was hyped as another , \" warped , twisted masterpiece \" of lynch clan . kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract . but , the result was extremely disappointing film , which quickly sank into well - deserved oblivion . the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh ( played by julian sands ) , talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena ( sherilyn fenn ) , beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair . cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re - establish the relationship . during one of such occasions , helena is hit by a car , and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her . after she wakes up , helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh ' s stylish residence , but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping . she is still trying to escape , so cavanaugh takes off her arms . apart from casting sherilyn fenn ( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart ) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies , this film by ms . lynch hasn ' t got anything in common with the works of director ' s more talented father . despite rather bizarre subject , the style of this film is conventional and setting is light , characters are beautiful - but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray . jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos . the actors aren ' t good either . julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man - this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains ; being neurotic doesn ' t suit him . bill paxton was better for this role , but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena ' s boyfriend . sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks , but even the her greater effort in acting couldn ' t help this film . the screenplay , on the other hand , is awful , at least for someone who had made best - seller with laura palmer ' s diary - the events in this movie are implausible , characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion . one of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh ' s \" regular \" girlfriend , played by betsy clarke . the twist at the end , although unpredictable , is unbelievable and the viewers , who had the stomach to endure entire film , would feel cheated . all in all , boxing helena is disorganised quasi - artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger ' s career .", "after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors , mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball . fiercely unoriginal , director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him . there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind . the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars . the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13 . interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001 : a space odyssey . instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie , de palma stops right there , refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart . mission to mars takes it ' s first wobbly steps at a pre - launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done . during these surface scans of the characters , we learn that jim mcconnell ( sinise ) has lost his wife . it ' s a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety . the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability . there is no contentiousness , no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time . maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff , but in that movie , the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects . it ' s the year 2020 and this is nasa ' s first manned excursion to the red planet . a crew , led by luke graham ( cheadle ) , arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly , which they investigate with tragic results . graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth . in response , earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell , woody blake ( robbins ) , wife terri fisher ( nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( o ' connell ) . obstacles are put in the crew ' s way and and they matter - of - factly go about solving them . i should say , mcconnell goes about solving them . time and again , mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind , which wouldn ' t be so bad if the rest of the crew didn ' t come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable . ( mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crew ' s mission and life is in mortal danger . on a team of professionals , she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link . women serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male character ' s personality trait . ) by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred , mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush . there is an adage in film to \" show , don ' t tell . \" mission to mars does both . repeatedly . characters obsessively explain the obvious , explain their actions as they are doing them , explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them . the film ' s conclusion is momumentally derivative , anti - climatic and unsatisying . as i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film . the best i could come up with is pre - teen age boys , but in this media saturated era , this film ' s components would have been old hat even for them . i have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good , modern day b - movie . the key to such a venture is a certain depth and sincerity towards the material . i felt no such earnestness .", "` the bachelor ' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see . wading through this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic . those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o ' donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; ` the bachelor ' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy . awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money . although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty - boy cocoon , chris o ' donnell has an effortless charm as an actor . most will recognize him as the high - flying robin from the two latest ` batman ' films , but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile . can o ' donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders ? perhaps , if he found the proper vehicle . . . but ` the bachelor ' falls far short of the requirements . the actor just can ' t register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success . a few instances of adorable humor aside , it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is ` the bachelor ' . o ' donnell plays jimmie , a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who ' s progressing in a serious relationship with anne ( renee zellweger ) . jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals , and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage . the problem is that his proposal sucks . big time . you can tell things aren ' t going pleasantly , because jimmie gets the infamous ? deer - in - the - headlights ' look when anne questions his approach . and then , the plot ( along with the stupidity of the movie ) thickens . jimmie ' s grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies suddenly , leaving a video will behind for his grandson ( who also happens to be his only living relative ) . everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie . of course , there ' s a catch : he must get married before his 30th birthday , stay joined with his bride for an entire decade , and produce healthy children within the first five years . the bad news is that jimmie ' s birthday is the following day . with anne out of town , he must find a willing bride to share his riches with . . . and within a very limited time frame . there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of ` the bachelor ' . for one , the movie ' s approach is interesting and not dripping with clich ? . another is the colorful cast . o ' donnell and zellweger are cute together , and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it ' s own mediocrity . ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure , and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie ' s marital adventures . and now the cons : the approach may be interesting , but in trying an old - fashioned method , director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel . the characters are drawn with obvious , broad strokes , and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable . yes , ` the bachelor ' is far more frustrating than cute . the screenplay is lamely written , and the subject matter poorly conceived . the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted , along with whatever promise the film initially contained . potential goes out the window early to suit sinyor ' s ` colorful ' approach , but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director ' s wishes . ` the bachelor ' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it . you ' ve seen the tv spots , haven ' t you ? o ' donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads ` what is this man running from ? ' in actuality , he ' s fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune ( it ' s one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film ) . after seeing the movie , i believe that the approaching horde could be something else . o ' donnell could be running from his angry fans , who have just endured ` the bachelor ' , and are hunting him down for revenge .", "you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following the \" odd couple ii \" sneak preview . they were as happy a group of men as i ' ve ever encountered . \" what a great movie , \" exclaimed one gent at the urinal , \" everything was so true ! \" \" yeah , \" laughed a man standing next to him , \" i drive as slow as that one guy did . my kids give me holy hell for it ! \" \" and peeing is a big part of my day , just like with felix , \" chuckled another fellow , as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and prepared to rejoin his wife . if you ' re over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limit , \" neil simon ' s the odd couple ii \" may be just the film for you . others will likely be less charitable . while \" the odd couple ii \" is amiable enough , neil simon ' s shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slapped - together tv reunion show , suffering from wheezing situation comedy set - ups and jokes straight out of the borscht - belt . simon , once the toast of broadway , has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson , missouri . the contrived story , involving the marriage of their kids , provides the excuse for a reunion between oscar madison and felix unger , who haven ' t seen each other in 17 years . the former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and , quite literally , run into one another at the airport . they take off in a rental car for the ceremony in san molina , get lost and have a series of \" wacky \" adventures on the road . jack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob . while there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair , the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that they ' ve headlined three films together since 1993 : \" grumpy old men , \" \" grumpier old men \" and \" out to sea . \" still , the two veteran actors are fun to watch . matthau , whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes , has a field day as oscar , the crown prince of the curmudgeons . lemmon , looking pastier than usual , is fine as the ever - annoying felix , who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of \" phnah ! phnah ! \" despite their bickering , the characters have real affection for each other , providing a welcome respite from the non - stop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together . unfortunately , matthau and lemmon ' s charm isn ' t enough to compensate for simon ' s hack script , which wouldn ' t pass muster even on a upn sitcom . one contrived situation follows another , lathered with enough stale one - liners to supply a dozen would - be comics on open - mike night at the local comedy club . if someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as i was , try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements . burger king gets one , as does the el pollo loco taco joint , but budget rent - a - car really hits the jackpot . between script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name , i couldn ' t keep count of all the plugs . i did , however , keep track of some of the swearing . i came up with four \" god - damns , \" three \" shitheads \" and two \" fucks . \" the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience , but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them , howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with a naughty word . it ' s sad that a writer of neil simon ' s stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs , but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise . one running gag involves oscar and felix ' s inability to remember the name of the town where the wedding is to be held . at one point , the men actually spend 30 seconds just free - associating , riffing off variants of the word \" san . \" the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing . one of the oldest maxims of film - going is \" beware of movies that use the author ' s name in the title . \" \" neil simon ' s the odd couple ii \" is no exception to the rule . while the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon , it has no business playing in a movie theater . of course , there ' s a bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word i ' ve written , and would probably whip my \" young - whippersnapper \" ass to boot . one thing ' s for sure , though . they ' ll never catch me in a car chase .", "\" i ' ve been told by several people , ' you ' re old fashioned . you want to do everything by hand , ' \" topiary gardener george mendonca complains , defending his continued resort to hand shears in trimming his intricately privet -

cutting among interviews and filmed segments , morris traces the lives of four disparate professionals who seem to share nothing but an immersion in their work , and then threads them around one another in an intricate quadruple helix . the fun is settling into your theater seat and wondering just what the hell one story can possibly have to do with the other . what morris manages is something akin to an intellectual magic trick , an interrogative sleight of hand . one of the things that feels different about an errol morris documentary -- besides the always - striking visuals -- is the interview style , where subjects seem to look directly at the viewer . weary of pressing his cheek against the camera lens to get this effect during conversations , morris developed an elaborate double - camera gadget he calls , half - jokingly , the interrotron . through a rig that uses a pair of teleprompters to project video images of the interviewer for the subject and vice versa , these folks talk , startlingly , right to the camera -- to the video image of morris , and by extension to the audience . the gardener wonders whether , after his death , anyone will be interested in maintaining the garden that he ' s devoted half his life to tending . the robot scientist is more than a little pleased to note that his creations may be primal examples of what an insect or even an animal is -- a complicated set of sensory receptors . the mole rat specialist is delighted to catalog the ways in which these vermin animals behave like insects , and notes that they may be more suited to long - term survival than people . and the circus trainer pines for a long - lost ideal that was exemplified by world - renowned trainer and showman clyde beatty , who starred in such serials as zombies of the stratosphere ( excerpted at some length here , with affection ) . starting to detect the patterns ? fast , cheap & out of control contains a multitude of parallels and tiny intersections , culminating in what feels like an elegy ( the film is dedicated to morris ' s late mother and stepfather ) . the film is balanced on that airy precipice dividing the already musty past from the alternately exhilarating and terrifying space that is the future . ( the title is taken from brooks ' wish that nasa would send a payload of hundreds of expendable robots to scurry about the martian surface , creating a sort of road map for the terrain -- fast , cheap , and out of control . ) with able assists from editors karen schmeer and shondra merrill and cinematographer robert richardson ( oliver stone ' s longtime collaborator ) , this becomes a cinematic contraption that ' s a wonder of narrative divergence and coherence . ( further enhancing the picture ' s wacky intellectual mood is the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson . ) different story threads inform and comment on one another with the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film , or a surrealist dream . by cobbling together out of these motley musings a thesis on the nature of craftsmanship , invention , and existence itself , morris reveals the presence of cosmic themes -- creation , evolution , death -- in earthbound lives . at the same time , and just as significantly , he pays tribute to a consuming passion for one ' s work . this breakdown of the dichotomy between the everyday and the extraordinary is likely as profound as anything you ' ll encounter in pop culture this year , and the visuals cry out for the big screen . don ' t miss it . -------------------------------------------------------------- directed by errol morris edited by karen schmeer and shondra merrill cinematography by robert richardson music by caleb sampson u . s . , 1997 --------------------------------------------------------------", "perhaps if the impostors didn ' t have so much going for it , it wouldn ' t have been such a tremendous disappointment . written , directed , and produced by one of its two stars , stanley tucci , whose last picture was the indie smash hit , big night , the impostors almost never catches fire . sputtering like a two - day old campfire , the story plays like an ad - lib sketch that was never polished or completed . the film ' s other star , oliver platt , was hilarious as the senator ' s aide in bulworth . the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent , including woody allen , steve buscemi , hope davis , alfred molina , campbell scott , lili taylor and tony shalhoub . all are wasted save allen , who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes . ( the audience will easily identify with allen ' s sentiments . ) with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror - imaged subtitles , the movie engenders little genuine laughter . the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it . the plot for the movie involves two starving actors , maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci ) , who accidentally end up on a cruise ship . in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor ( alfred molina ) , who is chasing them , they dress up as ship ' s stewards . the over - the - top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer . when the leads hide from their pursuers , arthur covers maurice ' s mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze . at other times , we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else , while darting in and out of staterooms . with the film ' s chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage , it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce . the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having . too bad they weren ' t more concerned with the audience ' s potential enjoyment . the jokes , frequently framed in silence , fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground . one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film ' s dailies . surely , if they had , they would have realized what leaden results they were producing . it is tricky having good actors play bad ones , but , if they couldn ' t pull it off , they should have just given up . \" the show is over for this fella , \" steve buscemi ' s character says towards the end . the mystery is why they didn ' t all give up in the beginning . there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast . the impostors runs 1 : 42 . it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .", "when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be \" you too can believe whales can fly \" . then it was going to be \" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly \" . then , it was going to be \" you too can believe wood sprites can fly \" . finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . . there ' s a lot of flying going on in this film ! as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $ 110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . subsequent re - releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . is the format effective for the film ? with a few exceptions , yes . the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven ' s fifth symphony . it ' s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat - like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat - like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . though this segment isn ' t very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . the next segment is set to ottorino respighi ' s \" the pines of rome \" . in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the \" oceans \" of clouds . again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . the cgi whales look incredibly life - like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . absolutely beautiful stuff . the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin ' s \" rhapsody in blue \" . this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . there ' s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out - of - work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . i won ' t go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . unfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich ' s \" piano concerto no . 2 \" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen ' s \" the steadfast tin soldier \" . a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind - up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can ' t see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack - in - the - box jester . the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . little does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . although the ending has been altered from the andersen story , \" the steadfast tin soldier \" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . some children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . segment five is the funniest of the bunch . set to camille saint - saens \" the carnival of the animals \" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo - yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it ' s the one that people remember most , \" the sorcerer ' s apprentice \" . the story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . unfortunately , the segment wasn ' t made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18 - plus screen theaters . segment seven is set to sir edward elgar ' s \" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 \" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character . donald duck \" stars \" as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark . during the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn ' t make it on the boat . they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners . despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear - jerkers foisted on audiences these days . powerful stuff . segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? \" saving the best for last \" . set to igor stravinsky ' s \" the firebird \" , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape . trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation . when the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird . in a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create . some amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) . the host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin ' s clip is pretty funny . be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin . penn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting . the best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board . pieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner ' s \" ride of the valkyries \" , and a strange segment prepared in the ' 40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments . for fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon . the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material . as i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters . i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though . then you too can believe that whales / triangle things / sprites can fly .

' here ' , of course , was still three months away . i ' ll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow . i ' d heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must - see list . that , let me tell you , has changed completely . i knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet . the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick . seriously . i ' ve never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie . . . . . sorry , make that ' roles ' in the movie . even travolta ' s great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage ' s character portrayals . my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler ' s hideout . half drugged out of his mind , he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son ' s death from castor ' s perspective - \" doesn ' t it just break your heart . \" he mutters coldly . now don ' t go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it ' s not . that ' s what really makes this movie unique . it ' s an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters . . . . . not a common mix at all . suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though . . . . . that ' s the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other . . . . and never hit . several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press ' rewind ' and watch it over again . the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double - sided mirror is just plain brilliant . whilst cage ' s and travolta ' s performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies , the lesser characters are just as intriguing . joan allen , who usually sticks to the straight drama movies , plays her part perfectly as archer ' s long suffering wife . i like the fact that her character didn ' t end up toting a gun at the end of the movie . . . it would have wrecked her potrayal . gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy ' s mistreated girlfriend . . . . . make that * one of * castor troy ' s mistreated girlfriends . other movies would have used her character as just window dressing . . . a sex object , but instead her character is very strong and independent . dominique swain , who plays archer ' s daughter , also does a nice job , though her character is not as explored as much as allen ' s or gershon ' s . faults ? well . . . there were some i have to say . first , the movie ' s ending , whilst being very good overall , was a bit too drawn out for it ' s own good . after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can ' t help but think - \" geez , are you guys nuclear powered or what ? \" . there were certain bits that weren ' t handled properly , like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform / prison - more explanation here would have been nice . overall , this movie was not perfect . but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect . many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made . . . . . i certainly hope so .", "capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp . to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity . the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone ' s taste . , + 3 ( - 4 to + 4 ) more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way . this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law . during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war . this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal . when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal . minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output . while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6 % mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27 % . the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad . that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do . the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day . and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll . in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany . filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese . there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps . certainly there was david lean ' s the bridge on the river kwai . there were some low - budget british exploitation films and that was about it . then there were tv series \" a town like alice \" and \" tenko . \" lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa . it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university . the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them . the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad . it turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves . beating and torture are commonplace events . men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable . however , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house . so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail - laying machine . this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies . the japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group ' s norms is all that gives a life meaning . conformity is purpose . before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp . if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story . if the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story . it is neither . it is a stirring and believable account of camp life . the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow . this serves a double purpose for cunningham . it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat . it also creates a distancing effect . the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music . this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience . i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a + 3 on the - 4 to + 4 scale .", "labelling is sometimes everything . in original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own . walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors . producers weren ' t thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones . on the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america . to make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago . instead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city . the gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx . that is far away from warriors ' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce . on the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city . crowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus . police simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs . the remaining eight , led by cleon ' s lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs . upon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status . however , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year . the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly . if walter hill ' s idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably . the future was much worse than his vision . the youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities . their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime . in their vocabulary , word \" arms \" is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns . they even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own . many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors . some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour . despite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film . the plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes . the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn ' t much bloodshed or gore in the movie . editing is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would - be - girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory . the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable . yet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity . best known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains . michael beck as cool , almost statesman - like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot - shot contender for top spot . all in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies .", "to sum the entire film \" 54 \" up in one sentence , it would be : watch a vh1 documentary instead . \" 54 \" , seems like someone brought william faulkner into 1978 , brought him into studio 54 , got him really drunk , told him to write about it , and then dumbed that down to be released to the public . a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex , drugs , and disco . the narrator , shane o ' shae ( ryan phillippe ) , works as a grease monkey in new jersey who , of course , on a whim decides to go into new york and try to get into studio \" 54 \" . phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young , attractive actor with a six pack stomach . he is let in by steve rubbell ( mike myers ) , the infamous co - owner of studio 54 , because he is attractive . he eventually becomes a bus boy and then a bartender . . . you expected more , didn ' t you . there isn ' t . the film builds up from nothing and becomes nothing as it ' s climax ( isn ' t that an apt word for studio 54 ) lands with a thud . the glitz of the club and perpetually semi - clothed patrons are used in an to attempt to show the it ' s glamour . for much of its target audience , college age to early thirties , it attempts to show celebrities mixing with \" normal people . \" this even fails since the only two celebs truly introduced are andy warhol and truman capote . you can be sure that half of the audience hasn ' t heard of them , another quarter only know their names , and the other quarter knew they were there already . the humor , if you can call it that , is built on an eighty year old woman getting high and 70s references like john travolta and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back then the best performance in the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high , sexually ambivlaent , very new york steve rubell . he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive . he looks like rubell and sounds just like him while giving a subdued , almost nostalgic performance , when needed . it reminds you of his saturday night live character linda richmond on \" coffee talk \" sans dress and wig . the supporting cast of salma hayek , breckin meyer , and neve cambell are their only there to give added subplots which are introduced but lead absolutely nowhere . the romance between phillippe and cambell , as a soap opera star , is completely implausable . the two share about half as much screen time as there are shots of the eighty year old hooked on amphetimenes . hayek ' s wanna - be singer seems extremely forced and her husband , greg ( meyer ) stands in as shane o ' shae ' s surrogate best friend . the subplots seemed forced and seem like they have been added just to make sure the film was over an hour and a half long . overall , \" 54 \" tried to give a view of the brashness of the place where crack flowed like heroin which flowed like wine . the film never leads to anything , has no obserable point , and covers up a lack of real plot with a veil of beautiful people . in truth , that reminded me of the eighies .", "curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour won ' t appeal to everyone . to be specific , let me give you an example . do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ? if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , don ' t see curdled . on the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at . our film ' s heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles . luckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big . the killer ' s nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he ' s played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler ) . one particularly striking m . o . on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims . gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests . she immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post - forensic cleaning service . no points for guessing what they do . her workmates are confused by gabriela ' s fascination with murder ; to them , it ' s just a day job . there ' s a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say . gabriela ' s partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela ' s wide - eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer ' s latest scene - they ' re the messiest , you see . unbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer , so he ' s also heading over there . . the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive - produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival . apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature - length film . there are other parallels - the star of curdled is angela jones ( the top billing goes to william baldwin , but really , jones is the central character ) , who ' s probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos , the death - obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction . that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film , curdled jr . jones is great in curdled - she ' s wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide - eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character ' s innocence or likeability . she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow . it ' s a great performance . reb braddock ' s direction is extremely sharp and clever , toeing the line between black humour and bad taste . the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing - any more than that would be a spoiler . the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing . of course , it ' s impossible to really take this stuff seriously , but then again you ' re not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke , and makes it a fun little romp as a result . the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film , and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time , and some parts just seem to drag . while its running time is already a short 94 minutes , it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing . curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax . it ' ll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well .", "so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successful sci - fi films such as close encounters of the third kind , 2001 : a space odyssey , apollo 13 and contact ? well , whatever it is , you ' d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange , considering the disastrous results we ' re left with here . this is a film that takes a little bit of everything , but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing ! it ' s like i said . . . this movie sucks . plot : a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020 , after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet . critique : extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movie . uneven , would be another . the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise , the buzz around it had been so - so , and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes , all leading you to believe that it ' s actually going to go \" somewhere \" . but it isn ' t long before the entire movie downshifts into neutral , features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry - colored planet , tries too hard to get us into the \" pain \" of some its characters and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix . in a sci - fi movie ? well , i don ' t know , much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour and a half , only to figure out some big secret in the end , a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement . ultimately , this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise , joins the crew in their \" misadventures in space \" for the main crux of its journey , and eventually settles down for one of the most anti - climactic endings this side of contact . mind you , if you enjoyed that film ' s shrug - of - the - shoulders ending , you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well . of course , i don ' t remember contact having such obvious and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story . ugh . what a friggin ' mess . films like this generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again . didn ' t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script ? didn ' t they read the bad dialogue , the cheezy lines , the obvious derivative nature of the work ( mind you , with a director like depalma at the helm , that ain ' t saying much ! ) . of course , you can ' t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o ' connell in this fine crew of thespians . ' nuff said . neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film ' s musical score during the last fifteen minutes , presumably in order to wake the audience up ( okay , we get it brian , this scene is supposed to be powerful . . . wow . . . yawn . . . my ears hurt ! ) . so is anything salvageable in this movie ? sure . gary sinise does another great job , as does cheadle , the film doesn ' t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really interesting happening , and yes , the \" sand - twister \" effect that you see in the commercial is well done . other than that ? i guess i could say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement strategies . . . oops , did i say \" admire \" , i meant \" am disgusted \" ! all in all , this movie delivers very little in actual substance , offers two - bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci - fi mumbo - jumbo , pretends to be deep when really it ' s just sappy , and eventually just settles into an ending which , other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story , gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our money back for sitting through this rehashed dreck . go see the ninth gate . . . now there ' s a great movie ! and on a personal note , i think it ' s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12 - minute uninterrupted film sequences , and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting .", "starring arnold schwarzenegger ; danny devito ; emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment , and a big one at that . junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman . these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins . so foolish me , i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins . so much for hopes . schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists ( doctors hesse and arbogast ) who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy . unfortunately , due to circumstances beyond their control , they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans , and subsequently lose their funding . still believing that their drug will work , they decide to test it anyway , on hesse . so , dr . hesse ( schwarzenegger ) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug . their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying , surely it will work on a woman . does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you ? well , it must have to the producers of junior . admittedly , schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off . perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny . but it wasn ' t , schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best . the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy , and the accompanying emotional swings , is not funny . schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics . i kept thinking to myself , with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture . better yet , with schwarzenegger , devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time , why didn ' t they make a sequel to twins ? anything would have been better than this mess . danny devito is wasted in this movie . his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street . ( after seeing the movie , if i was devito , i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street . ) emma thompson is wasted here as well . while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations , she is also a fine comedian . too bad she didn ' t get to use any of that talent here . am i being too hard on this film ? i don ' t think so . schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today , and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood . with a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella , the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film . they certainly managed here . maybe it was well intentioned , but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made . if you are tempted to see this film , do yourself a favor and go rent twins , a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito ' s comedic talents .", "by phil curtolo \" madonna - antonio banderas - jonathan price - in an alan parker film - with music from andrew lloyd weber - and lyrics by tim rice - evita . \" now i have to admit , the trailer for this rock - opera - turned - major motion picture is almost breath - taking for some . the soundtrack is wonderful to listen to . so why wouldn ' t the movie be wonderful to see . simple , a little over 2 hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane . the story of eva duarte ( madonna ) , evita is full of drama that ' s trapped inside by all the notes and chords . she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming a hooker , then goes into the field of acting , and finally meets juan peron ( price ) , the soon - to - be first president of argentina . they fall in love and eventually marry . sounds pretty good , doesn ' t it . well the story gets better , as eva goes on the \" rainbow tour \" across europe , trying to win respect . eva duarte was a wonderful lady . however , all of the drama - packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood . i went into theater 4 at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and i left with happy , because i was right . they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar . although it did come off as dull , the beautiful cinematography is eye - catching , as was madonna ' s performance . as the \" spiritual leader of argentina , \" madonna would have definitely been an oscar - contender had she spoken a single line . but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film . don ' t get me wrong and don ' t look at my grade . i am not a big fan of musicals on the big screen . if you ' re going to pay to see a movie , you want to see a movie . now i have to admit , it ' s a lot cheaper to pay $ 5 than $ 200 plus to see the play , but that ' s what did me in . all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before i even saw the movie . now you may be saying , \" what kind of critic is he ?

d . carpenter ' s need for close - ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation . we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ? and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here . carpenter ' s script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness . this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around . the second lamest device , of course , is the , \" oh , it was all a dream \" resolution . and guess what ? this movie has both ! not that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile . since there ' s no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere . that ' s a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples . carpenter can ' t even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg - 13 movies like bring it on and get over it .

penn ) dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason ( jesse james ) . during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean . the letter , written to a mystery woman named catherine , instantly captivates her . upon her return , theresa shares it with her best friend lina ( illeana douglas ) , her boss charlie ( robbie coltrane ) , and the entire city of chicago ( the newspaper publishes an article about it ) . it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down . he turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing . this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship . of course she doesn ' t tell him that she found his letter , she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later ( preferably right after they first make love ) . this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened . the discovery of the message and garret ' s discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film . there ' s a truly lame subplot about garret ' s relationship with his dead wife ' s family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother , played by john savage ) and then the necessary tear - jerking ending . a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die , although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel . the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced , and unintentionally humorous , sequences filmed since . . . well , since costner ' s the postman ( 1997 ) . message in a bottle is one slow moving film . last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this . they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work . message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they ' re fighting the material all the way , and losing badly . costner and , especially , wright - penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring . they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry . the supporting players are given very little to do . the reliable douglas is particularly wasted . old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film . a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played . however , too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are . the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story . gabriel yared , who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient ( 1996 ) and city of angels ( 1998 ) with his scores , overdoes it a bit here . caleb deschanel ' s camera makes everything look a little too beautiful . do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly ? the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times . the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego . working from a best - selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times . its strict adherence to clich ? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 ) . there simply isn ' t an original scene in this film . the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking . this is director mandoki ' s first film since when a man loves a woman ( 1994 ) , the solid meg ryan / andy garcia romance . he ' s simply going through the motions with this . message in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come ( 1998 ) as one of the most misguided romances of the decade .", "the tagline for this film is : \" some houses are just born bad \" . so i didn ' t expect too much from this . but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre . i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont . i thought , mabe it will be fun ? and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing . but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? . these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality . here is the story : in the monstrously over - decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation . among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) . actually , the doctor is researching the \" primordial fear reaction \" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens . but he gets unexpected help from the house itself . it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights . portals become veiny stained - glass eyeballs . a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth . filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains . but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen . the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture . is that exciting or what ? the worst thing about it is that it didn ' t have to be bad . it ' s based on a great book , `` the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson . a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent . it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience . \" the blair witch project \" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses . and with a $ 70 mill . budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror . de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening . he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush . but why give him a more serious material ? in the end \" haunting \" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont ' s career as a director . yet it wouldn ' t be fair to say that everything is bad . the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky . but this is where the good things end . the music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life . it ' s nothing more than a special effects - extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn ' t engage . at first you do not know what ' s going on . is this part of the experiment ? are these hallucinations ? projections of the subconscience ? paranoia ? but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening . the house is actually possessed . it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window . for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that ' s what i got ? i believe hichock once said that \" it ' s better to wait for a climax , than to see one \" . this may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid . they are impossible to take seriously . any paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick ' s \" the shining \" , are absolutely baseless . \" shining \" had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality . \" haunting \" has only special effects and art direction to boast of . and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film . casting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse . but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : \" some films are just born stupid \" .", "bob the happy bastard ' s quickie review : the odd couple ii grumpy old men , it ain ' t . hell , my fellow americans , it ain ' t . walter matthau and jack lemmon team up again for an even more worn out vehicle than any of their films over the past few years . odd couple ii feels terribly generic , where in the first movie , made thirty one years ago , feels like a wonderful tale . that ' s like repackaging campbell ' s soup in a generic food can , really . how writer neil simon could ' ve made such a horrible mistake in screen writing is beyond me . throughout the movie , i really didn ' t laugh once . honestly . i mean , there were dumb situations , yeah , like the cropduster who let these old geezers have it without any notice , but they just really didn ' t seem funny to me . and that car rolling off the cliff ? the only way i would ' ve seen humor in that is if they were still in it . and the ending gets all super - mushy , too . in the final twenty minutes or so , lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the one , then loses her ; matthau talks to his son ( a wasted jonathan silverman ) about his amrriage to lemmon ' s daughter ; and , of course , lemmon and matthau have another roomie situation on their hands . ooh , i really gave a lot away there , i ' m sure . consider it a hospitable gester , you won ' t waste your time renting this muck .", "the \" disney stick - to - what - you - do - best \" rule states that disney ' s animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at live - action kids ' entertainment , they will fail miserably . this goes double for occasions when they try to make a live - action adaptation of a popular cartoon ( remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations ? i ' m still trying to forget ) . that rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget , an insulting , despicable and , worst of all , expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable children ' s film . it will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults , even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes . it ' s films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects . just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet , his career takes a nosedive to hell with his \" role \" as john brown , a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around him . he dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush , dr . brenda bradford ( joely fisher ) . but after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer . john breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr . brenda ' s father . dr . brenda has been working on a \" gadget project , \" which would make a half - man half - machine super - policeman to fight crime . feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject , realizing his dream of becoming a policeman . now , when he says \" go go gadget [ insert name of gizmo here ] \" he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks , bang up bandits and mangle murderers . in the meantime , the evil claw ( rupert everett ) , the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor ' s father is building a gadget of his own : a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown ' s worst nemesis . claw has plans of world domination , which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile ( voice of d . l . hughley ) to save humanity from his wrath . state of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $ 90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere . had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect . what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal : all of the expensive f / x amounts to nothing . part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie . can kids really admire a hero so goody - two - shoes that he screams \" hey ! you ran a stop sign ! \" while hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle ? i think that today ' s children will respond better to somebody dashing , someone ultra - cool . they ( probably ) receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt . in addition to the more complex complaints above , there ' s also the simple stuff : inspector gadget is boring , formulaic and achingly implausible . there ' s no feeling that the director really cares about his story : more than any other film i ' ve seen this year , this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line . there ' s a popular commercial ( for sprite , but that ' s irrelevant ) running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects . it consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious ( thank god ) movie called \" death slug \" . each executive gleefully presents a different merchandise tie - in ( slug taco ! slug on a stick ! ) . at the end one of them asks \" what about the movie ? \" another answers : \" well , we don ' t have a script yet , but we can bang one out by friday . \" they probably could have replaced \" death slug \" with inspector gadget . this film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script . it ' s no coincidence that most good children ' s entertainment these days comes from animation . animated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride into their work . these kinds of films are banged out quicker and a good percentage turn out worthless , sloppy and impersonal . the studios are becoming factories and films their assembled products . ? 1999 eugene novikov &# 137 ;", "i know it already opened in december , but i finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend , and it was one of those rare oppritunites that i got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price . as the final scene closed out in happy slow - mo fashion , i felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking . jason schwartzman , his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses , steals the show as max fischer , the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades , but compensates for it by organizing most of the school ' s clubs and organizations ( i . e . the fencing team and writing and producing school plays ) and often pulling outrageous stunts , one that eventually earns him an expulsion . this stunt , building an aquarium on the school ' s baseball diamond , is a plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) . he funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume ( a very oscarworthy bill murray ) , who eventually finds himself falling in love with miss cross . rosemary and herman begin dating - and the fun begins ; herman and max go at it head to head in a battle for miss cross . herman manages to destroy max ' s bike , while max cuts herman ' s brakes , and it goes on like this . but eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross , and he can ' t stand in the way of two people in love . the academy of arts & sciences really messed up this year ; they completely overlooked rushmore ( and , if you ask me , it wasn ' t an accident ) . it maybe wasn ' t best picture material , but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod ( instead of elizabeth ) , and bill murray ' s absense from the ballot is a complete snub . the entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good ; at one point it ' s fun , and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic . the cinematography gives the movie an important feeling , as well . i hope rushmore can overcome its ' oscar snubs , and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers .", "i ' m not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson ' s political satire \" wag the dog , \" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn ' t do that . they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all - too - true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn ' t quite do that either . a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick ' s \" dr . strangelove \" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn ' t do that . that said , \" wag the dog \" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re - election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . the accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn ' t particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president ' s campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . brean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special - effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . as i said , \" wag the dog \" is not quite as laugh - out - loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform \" we have the right to fight for democracy . \" another scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team ' s attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . william \" old shoe \" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex - military officer who turns out to be a first - class psycho . of course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what ' s going on and strikes a deal with the president ' s electoral opponent to report to the media that the \" fighting \" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . still , even with the cia ' s involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . regardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn ' t the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? the film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . schumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . there was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss ' s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . with these plot holes , \" wag the dog \" doesn ' t quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . motss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . in fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss ' s increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . i think it ' s fair to say that \" wag the dog \" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four - star film and a classic satire . still , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn ' t even real ? with this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws .", "susan granger ' s review of \" jeepers creepers \" ( mgm / ua entertainment ) this nasty , little horror film begins as a bickering brother ( justin long ) and sister ( gina philips ) are driving through the desolate countryside on their way home from college and spy a man dropping wrapped -

well , this is it ! \" philips warns . what he finds in the basement of an old , abandoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying , jagged - stitched incision from his neck to his navel , plus hundreds of other mutilated bodies , stitched together on the walls and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry . long flees but now the monstrous , winged creeper ( jonathan breck ) is after both of them ! eileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady and patricia belcher is jezelle , a psychic who explains the evil creature ' s bizarre feeding habits . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" jeepers creepers \" is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extraordinarily gruesome conclusion , giving new meaning to the old song \" jeepers creepers . \" and now - as paul harvey would say - for the rest of the story . what ' s more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself is the fact that writer / director victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself having oral sex with a 12 year - old actor in california . sentenced to three years in prison , he served 15 months and completed parole in 1992 . when salva made \" powder \" ( 1995 ) , the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilities , disney studio executives claimed that they did not know about his prior conviction as a pedophile . and now , once again , in this mgm / ua film , that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio .", "warning : anyone offended by blatant , leering machismo had better avoid this film . or lots of blood & guts , men against men and mano -

motion shoot - ups .", "it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of today \u0012 s movies or novels , you must \u0013 suspend disbelief . \u0014 however , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies . it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald ' s , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by . even if you can ignore these somewhat \u0013 white \u0014 lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rain \u0012 s plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just don \u0012 t gel . firstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . he _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases . i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started . but nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van . with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesn \u0012 t take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road . jim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars . but of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town . the local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he / she would do with their share of the three million dollars . director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy - turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite \u0013 goodies versus baddies , \u0014 there are numerous twists in it \u0012 s plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience . but by the time these interesting changes occur , it \u0012 s far too late in the film for them to have much affect . hard rain \u0012 s continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although it \u0012 s cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par . not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected . such titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face / off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations . strangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta . we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character . if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no . i now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you don \u0012 t believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) . although hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen . the addition of an enticing sub - plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that can \u0012 t handle anything else . despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film . no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesn \u0012 t really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $ 8 . 50 is compare this to other films .", "carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven ( robocop ) came together to create the 1990 mega hit that is total recall . the film is a masterpiece of sets , action , and special effects . action and science fiction just don ' t get any better than this ! the story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid ( arnold schwarzenegger ) who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori ( sharon stone ) . quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice ; a brain implant ( fake memory ) of a two week vacation on mars . while being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaid ' s memory has previously been erased . now the people who did it are after him . quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead . the plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action , special effects , and twist after mind - boggling twist . it grabs you and never lets go ! this film is a winner from beginning to end . the plot is superb ; combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a rip - roaring saga . schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever , and the supporting cast is good too . the action and stunts are terrific . the sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail . the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action . the make - up effects by rob bottin ( the howling , the thing , and robocop ) are top notch , not to mention extremely outlandish . the visual effects by dream quest ( the abyss ) and industrial light and magic ( star wars trilogy , jurassic park , and terminator 2 ) are phenomenal ! the visuals had such a state of the art \" slickness \" that they won an oscar . of course the film isn ' t always realistic ; it ' s more fiction than science . for example , it is true that a body won ' t explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do . who cares ? it ' s a movie . movies are supposed to entertain . and in my opinion this film achieves an entertainment level in film that is so terrific , it may be impossible to beat .", "on the basis of this film alone , i never would have predicted that , in two years , quentin tarantino would become the country ' s biggest hotshot director . reservoir dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged in pulp fiction , but is a much less substantive , more conventional crime story than the big pf . here ' s what the two movies do have in common . . . -- scenes of intelligent , amusing dialogue with no relevance to the plot -- a story that jumps back and forth in time rather than going in a logical , chronological sequence -- graphic yet necessary violence -- an engaging crime story -- dialogue liberally spiced with swear words and racial / gender slurs -- three of the same actors ( harvey keitel , tim roth and steve buscemi ) -- a mexican standoff ending , although this one is considerably less optimistic than pf reservoir dogs is an entire hour shorter than pulp fiction because it ' s only got one story to tell rather than three . crime lord joe cabot ( veteran actor lawrence tierney ) has assembled five criminals who have never even met each other to pull a diamond store heist . the five are instructed not to reveal their real names or personal details or anything the cops could use if one of them was captured and interrogated . instead , they are all given code names off the color chart -- mr . white ( keitel ) , mr . pink ( buscemi ) , mr . orange ( roth ) , mr . blonde ( michael madsen ) , mr . brown ( tarantino ) and mr . peach ( tarantino ' s chin ) . most of the movie ' s running time is spent with mr . white and pink waiting at a warehouse for the others to arrive . mr . orange , meanwhile , is on the floor , dying from a gunshot wound . the police had arrived at the scene of the crime way too soon , leading white to believe one of the five was an informant . the story ' s background unfolds through a series of flashbacks , of the crime itself and the meetings between joe and the criminals prior to the crime . eventually , blonde arrives with a police officer hostage , and what follows is a truly brutal , uncomfortable torture scene . let ' s just say picasso would be inspired by what blonde does to the cop ' s ear . a lot of the time , reservoir dogs seems like your typical gangster heist - gone - wrong movie , but there are a few sequences that are uniquely tarantino . the opening scene in the coffee shop starts the movie off on a high note the rest of it doesn ' t live up to , as the criminals plus joe have a conversation on , among other things , tipping philosophies and their interpretations of madonna ' s \" like a virgin . \" another scene involves roth ' s lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana . neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop , like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction , only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie . reservoir dogs is good but it ' s no pulp fiction .", "i didn ' t hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film . for the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored . i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it ' s entertaining to watch it in the same way that it ' s entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl . as a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries . it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways . it ' s fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they ' re doing . unfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don ' t seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy . the biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place . but it sure is a fascinating failure . marky . . . er , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman . he ' s a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn ' t snipe or make clean kills -- he just kicks the door down and shoots everything ) . he works with a few other hitmen -- cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) . they ' re a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex . they all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen . it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in . they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father . when they do this , it turns out she is paris ' . . . goddaughter ! it ' s very bad to have paris against you . the story is standard action film stuff . it ' s nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) . clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it ' s a john woo - type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy . it ' s true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face / off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) . there are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story . they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns . melvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives . like i said , it ' s not boring ; most disasters aren ' t . what makes it so bad is its genre - shifting madness . it seems to start out as a quirky - but - realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains . then , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere . then , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy . keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words . and scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all . one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator . the scene is played for laughs , but it isn ' t funny . and since it doesn ' t quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails . this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun . cars land on tree branches and are supported by them . characters betray each other without a second thought . grenades are thrown in tight places . people jump out of tall buildings and survive . people outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds . most frustrating of all , though , is the film ' s definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals . they ' re more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand - held machineguns ) . the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn ' t make for deep or interesting people to watch . the acting is kind of fun , though -- wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way . phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin ' s fianc ? e , is convincingly air - headed . the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny . the funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one - liners . it ' s a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional . despite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here . you can cherish the awfulness of a film like this . if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself .", "what ' s shocking about \" carlito ' s way \" is how good it is . having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino ' s previous film , \" scent of a woman , \" and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , \" carlito ' s way \" was destined for underrated heaven . that ' s what it is : an underrated gem of a movie . and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study . \" carlito ' s way \" deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex - drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke - addicted , curly - haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality . of course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he ' s really a crook at heart . carlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can ' t escape into something he is not . carlito ' s attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn . when he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot - out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive . he ' s constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he ' s doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck - deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking . carlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that ' s where it ' s at ) , but needs some funding . being a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k . c . and the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite ) . he gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he ' s constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco \" from the bronx \" ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito . on the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison . she ' s a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami . while this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down ) . all of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable . when i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it . sure , it ' s going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate . what ' s amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills . like \" apollo 13 , \" we know what ' s going to happen , but we ' re still thrilled by what happens in the middle . it ' s also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller . de palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films . his earlier flim , \" scarface \" ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i ' m still not over ) . but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes . to me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet . this is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history . with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito ' s head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino ' s face , it ' s a tear - jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you . . . ) . the acting from all is great , especially from the three leads . pacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent wasn ' t puerto rican enough and , well , it wasn ' t as \" strong \" as his oscar - winning role in \" scent of a woman . \" well , his \" scent of a woman \" performance was great and all , but it was nothing really but , as comic kevin pollack said , a \" foghorn leghorn impression . \" in \" carlito ' s way , \" he ' s emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he ' s remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he cannot change . i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango - dancing , insult - throwing blind guy in \" scent of a woman . \" as i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry . and they ' re scenes are well - written , with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship . and sean penn is amazing as the coke - addicted rat attorney . every scene he ' s in , he has great energy , and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino . in smaller roles , john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great . \" carlito ' s way \" is one of those films which you heard about briefly , but when you finally watch it , you ' re absolutely blown away . it ' s a wonderful film , a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn ' t do so hot . but trust me and check it out . it ' s a great little film , and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right .", "poster boy for co - dependency needs patching patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman mediocrity is a pox on civilization . in our heavily consumer oriented society , there is an enormous demand to churn out \" stuff . \" what would happen to our economy if we didn ' t feel the need to have more things ? to make us buy more , businesses need to produce a ton of product . the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality . the film industry is like any other . in order for studios to survive , they have to make money . the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit . some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that , less talented people are used . there aren ' t enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary . for some reason , it ' s never crossed anyone ' s mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit . often , mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones . at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies . i ' m not suggesting that \" patch adams \" was tossed out just to rake in the bucks . my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel . it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story , but it ' s as dull as could be . hunter \" patch \" adams ' ( robin williams ) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis . checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt , he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around . patch could be a poster boy for co - dependency . he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn ' t focus on his own problems . he decides that he wants to be a physician , leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia . as a med student , patch ' s antics at the school ' s hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch - enemy , straight - laced dean walcott ( bob gunton ) . the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he ' s one of the top students . he writes in patch ' s academic file that he shows \" excessive happiness . \" i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing . there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies . then it struck me . it must be based on a true story . the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute , a free clinic . robin williams is an amazing actor . while he is adept at dramatic roles , his forte is over - the - top free spirits . that ' s what makes his failure here so remarkable . patch is exactly the character he should be best at , yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat . something holds him back . most of the rest of the cast is two - dimensional . for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings , it ' s curious that the ones here are cardboard characters . peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person . unfortunately he ' s in the film for only about two minutes . the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene . we ' re not left to our own emotional decisions : we ' re hit over the head with them . shaved -

wrestling , they ' re all part of the movie ' s raucous , complex storyline . but even trash tv topicality can ' t drag \" wild things \" down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you ' d find late - night on the usa network , only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast . despite a smattering of needless scenes ( most of them sexual in nature ) , there ' s wicked fun to be had here . \" wild things \" would be a guilty pleasure , only there ' s no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it . high school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well - liked in the town of blue bay , especially by pretty , popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave ' s most financially prominent . hoping to take her crush to a physical level , kelly seductively slinks into lombardo ' s house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser , but , the very next day , tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped . before long , blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin - vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly ' s rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell ) . lombardo , who maintains his innocence , hires neck brace - sporting , opportunistic lawyer ken bowden ( bill murray ) to defend him in court . the previews give away the following revelations , so if you haven ' t seen any of the movie ' s spots on the television or in the theater , you might want to skip to the next paragraph . while cross - examining suzie on the witness stand , bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her . to pay lombardo for the damages , kelly ' s mother breaks her daughter ' s trust fund and gives him $ 8 . 5 million . but lombardo , kelly and suzie are actually all working together , and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can . duquette and perez , however , begin to suspect that there ' s more afoot to the case than just false accusations . if there ' s a major drawback to \" wild things , \" it ' s that it ' s oversexed to a fault . the much - talked - about hotel room menage - a - trois between dillon , campbell and richards is a turn - off . it ' s also cut short ( sorry , guys ) , and should have been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often . what we don ' t see is far more effective than what we do . another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene . er , no thanks . also , bacon ' s duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten . daphne rubin - vega , from broadway ' s \" rent , \" tries to compensate for a superfluous character . theresa russell is just plain wooden . and when , in the end , all is out in the open , ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary . but what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises ( some predictable , some not ) that never seems to end . \" wild things \" has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews , and most are so gleefully , over - the - top nasty that you can ' t help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship . a great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent ; murray ' s a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo ' s case and flipping them off . and don ' t leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you ' ll miss the film ' s best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell . speaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in \" starship troopers . \" matt dillon flexes his sleepy - voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision . neve campbell , lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig , gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio . re - edited and toned down a bit , the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths . but what we ' re given works well enough . \" wild things \" is highly entertaining and , indeed , very wild .", "capsule : the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi -

4 to + 4 ) mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala . her newest film , written by sabrina dhawan , is very similar to previous films like betsy ' s wedding but it is set in new delhi . a wealthy family is having a wedding . an indian wedding is a multi - day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial . even more than in the us , it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get - together . the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members ' individual story lines . aditi verma is marrying hemant , an indian engineer working in the us . she had previously had a relationship with vikram , her supervisor . latit , her father ( played by naseeruddin shah ) , is juggling many problems , not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey . dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration . even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice , one of the family servants . several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex , family secrets , or both . there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love . some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films . western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna . on the other hand it was not clear ( to me at least ) if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films . this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english . the latter will , however , help with an international release . sabrina dhawan ' s screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog . we have seen films with plotting very much like this , but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference . director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life . i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low + 2 on the -

stopping performance at the legendary concert hall . roberta guaspari ( academy award winner meryl streep ) has two kids , a husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean . her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school . she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors . that is the pattern - like plot of this production . ultimately , the film chooses a zero - sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an all - time high when the men in her life finally vanish . the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful . roberta ' s character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat . also lacking depth is the film ' s \" bad guy , \" a narrow - minded music teacher ( josh pais ) who rejects roberta out of principle ( the movie never explains exactly which principle that is ) and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around . the next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre . they are highlighted by one child ' s return to roberta ' s class ( coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can ' t be around anymore because \" my mom said . . . \" ) and a glowing concert . not knowing the running time , you may expect the credits to role at this point . but they don ' t . instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent . director wes craven , known for his works of horror , uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing . one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic \" but . . . last night . . . \" and roberta ' s two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father ' s absence . the city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie . roberta ' s mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype . the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens ; predictably one of roberta ' s students is gunned down and killed off screen . one thing the film does lack is subtlety . the fact that a little boy was playing \" we shall overcome \" on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference . the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience . ( of course , in horror films the foreshadowing and between - the - line moments are meant to be overdone , so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game . ) even with all its flaws , music of the heart is a beautiful film . that is not an excuse for the movie ' s poor beginning . but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall , i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage . in december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history . the performance included a dead - on elvis impression , robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies . so , how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life ? he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience . perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santa ' s favorite food , this movie has an amazing finale .", "warning : if you actually wish to see the film , stop reading this and see it . while i don ' t blow any plot details , the more you know about a movie , the more disappointing and built up it becomes ( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing ) . but , in a nutshell , it ' s a good film . star wars episode i : the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world ( i was more into star trek : the next generation ) , it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment , the phantom menace . however , it can ' t be ignored . endless toys lining the shelves , endless news reports , and a multi - billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult . with the level of this hype , one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998 , godzilla , which definitely failed to live up to expectations . thankfully , the phantom menace does much , much better . while the \" first \" star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker , the prequels backpedal to tell the back - story of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker ( who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader ) . without blowing too much of the story , the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo , which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation , and it ' s up to two jedi knights ( qui - gon ji , played by liam neeson and obi - wan kenobi , played by ewan mcgreggor ) to free it . the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics , leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat . common complaints range from lack of characterization , weak narrative , poor direction of actors , the dated style , and too much focus over special effects . still , film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism , much of which the average film buff does not care for . hence , this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films ( even with the \" improvements \" in the special editions ) . there are many memorable sequences throughout the film , ranging from the fast and furious \" pod race \" sequence ( which is a take on the chariot races in \" ben hur \" ) and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids . utilizing technology that is light years beyond anything made before , special effects and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail . no matter how many times you watch this film , you will catch something new . the level of humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well , mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks , who belongs to a race known as the gungans . best described as an mr . bean from the planet naboo , he steals the show . unfortunately , being that he is a computer - generated character , tells a bit about the direction of the actors ( although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective , as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker ) . with star wars mania at an all time high , there is the risk that the film will disappoint ( i myself had my doubts ) , which this film does have a tendency to do at times . there are a few logic problems with the plot , several things are left unchecked , and at times seems to be made only for diehard star wars fans ( although the appearance of the tusken raiders makes for more than a few laughs ) . that , and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character , coming off as a smarmy , arrogant brat ( with such an attitude , it ' s no wonder why he turns to the dark side ) . still , it seems that many people , especially critics , are missing the point . the film is some of the most fun 2 and a half hours that you ' ll blow in your life , which is something i wouldn ' t mind doing again . while it may not have the psychological impact of an academy award contender , who really cares ? the film is pure fun from beginning to end . and isn ' t that what really matters ?", "die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect . place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film ' s pathetic screenplay . every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor . the plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land . the film has zero credibility , and all of the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut - outs . so much for the script . how about the action ? well , let ' s put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator -- all standouts for their hair - raising suspense . by contrast , harlin doesn ' t have a clue when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2 never picks up steam . die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute . in fact , the movie often seems deliberately campy , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it ' s good . you do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it . die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff .", "barely scrapping by playing at a nyc piano bar , timothy hutton returns to his massachusetts hometown for a couple of weeks . on the surface , he ' s coming home for a high school reunion , but since this is a movie , you know that he ' s really looking for some major life decisions . a fairly \" small \" film , this sports an impressive ensemble cast including uma thurman , rosie o ' donnell and a bunch of actors that you ' ve seen before but can ' t quite place . commendable jobs all around ; they seem like real people . hutton arrives at his past and is greeted by his spirit - dead father , terminally goony brother and old high school chums . all of his old buddies are engaged in the snow removal business and most are in the midst of a relationship crisis . the perfect stuff for a comedy about people in the twenties angst . he meets and falls for the new next door neighbor : a beautiful intelligent lively girl who is obviously taken with him . the problem is that she is only 13 . unconsummated ( no , it ' s not _that_ type of movie ) , their relationship builds and neither knows what to do with it . star - crossed lovers with no where to go . so hutton is gaga over a barely - teen , one of his buddies is two - timing his girlfriend with a married old flame , another ' s girlfriend is sleeping with a meat cutter ( \" and she ' s a vegetarian ! \" ) . things are a mess . enter uma thurman . the beautiful stranger in town for a few days is both a delight in the film and one of its minor downfalls . her character is fun to watch . even more entertaining is observing the guys falling over themselves trying to impress her . like the lone ranger , before she leaves , she solves most of the problems and sets everyone onward with their lives . the ending is a bit too pat . everything is tied up with a neat little bow . rosie o ' donnell is a stand - out in her limited screen time with her brash personality and \" tell it like it is \" pronouncements . structured somewhat like a \" diner , a few years later \" , this feel - good story is a good time , but ends a little too nice .", "8mm is not going to enlighten your day . it ' s a dark , grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence . not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess , you ' ll require a lot of patience as well . nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late . he wore a bizarre get - up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes , and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality . cage plays private investigator tom welles , praised for his secrecy and reliability . at home , welles is a family man , with a wife ( catherine keener ) and a small daughter to take care of . his new assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband ' s safe . the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man , until the girl is brutally murdered . or so it seems . welles , of course , begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth . and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case , the more he gets in over his head . he hires an adult book store clerk named max california ( joaquin phoenix ) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography . max knows what welles is getting himself into , and explains , ` you dance with the devil , the devil don ' t change . the devil changes you . ' these turn out to be very wise words . 8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution . the set - up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her . this is where everything goes awry . although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the ` real world ' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula . everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless , repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects . although it had enormous potential , the third act of 8mm is a total bust , leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control . cage is the film ' s sole flame of energy . his performance is actually believable , but soon the director ' s demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation . still , you ' ve got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand . welles ' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest - hitting snuff films in the industry . this is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer - like phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film . he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie . written by andrew kevin walker , 8mm dissipates into a poor man ' s seven , with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece . furthermore , what has become of joel schumacher ? the director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin , anyone ? ) . this putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career , so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side .", "with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft ' s square pictures , final fantasy , inspired by the top -

invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul ( for some unexplainable reason ) . while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein ( james woods ) to blast the aliens with a \" zeus cannon , \" dr . aki ross ( ming -

heavy star trek episode , an installment of die hard , or a sappy love story , depending on who ' s doing the talking . for the most part , it ' s bearable considering the genre , but tedious speeches and cheesy lines don ' t do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes . the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming , who always has great cracks during tense moments . but , when the lights come up and the credits roll , you ' re more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked . there ' s no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie , and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film . you ' d be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more .", "ex - universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer - model engineered fighters gone bad . the review jean - claude van damme has a one - liner early on in universal soldier : the return , his latest attempt to remain relevant , that sums up this entire movie ; he says \" been there , done that . \" no film critic could possibly sum up van damme ' s recent film choices any better . while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films ) , van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him : martial arts and guns . this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world , with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex . he joins fellow martial artist / action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away . universal soldier : the return is truly poor . the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade , specifically terminator 2 : judgement day and the similarly named soldier . soldier ' s kurt russell was an older model super - soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors , for the good of a planet ; schwarzenegger ' s terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine , the t - 1000 ; and jean - claude , a former universal soldier , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of , you guessed it , newer model soldiers . considering the poor box office performance of soldier , it ' s amazing that this project was ever given the go - ahead . luc devereaux ( van damme ) was the sole remaining universal soldier ( or unisol for short ) , until he was returned to a normal , if muscular , human form . in this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series , following two straight - to - video duds that were ignored here plot - wise ) , luc is now a human trainer / consultant of sorts for the unisol program . working with dylan cotner ( xander berkeley , who interestingly also appeared in t2 ) , the unisol program has engineered a tougher , fiercer fighting force with the help of super - computer seth . unfortunately , upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government , seth takes control of his soldiers , killing everyone in the building except for luc , his partner maggie , his daughter hillary and erin , a reporter trapped inside . the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive , while beating up a group of near - indestructible soldiers , most notably romeo ( popular wrestler goldberg ) . there are lots of fights , gun battles , lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility . there are so many clich ? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch . luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on , and in the course of a single night , they go from bickering to falling for each other , to kissing . erin is a pathetically - written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her , and yet , not only does this not seem to frighten her , but she finds time to remind luc that she \" isn ' t leaving without her story \" . whatever . other laughable moments include a ) luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what ? ) and b ) a group of rangers , who after having been given good advice ( luc tells them that their weapons are useless , and shows them a specific gun which should work better ) , choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway ( guess who wins the battle ? ) . not one single scene in universal soldier : the return has any originality to it . when fuelled by don davis ' loud , driving music score , the film ' s many fights become almost passable , but mostly are full of the same ol ' jean - claude moves . director mic rodgers ( a former stunt co - ordinator ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace , with only a few token serious moments to be found . his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows , tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion . if only jean - claude weren ' t getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li , rodgers could probably have made a decent action film . to place the blame squarely at van damme ' s feet , however , is an injustice . i ' m not sure that anyone , not even robert deniro or edward norton , could make writers william malone and john fasano ' s script sound good . one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access . he cringes , looks down and mutters \" uh . . . uhm . . . they all do , i saw it on 60 minutes . eh he he he \" the script ' s and indeed the entire film ' s only saving grace is goldberg . he chews up every scene he is in , obviously enjoying his role immensely . he even gives the film a few laughs , as he mutters things like \" i really don ' t like that guy \" every time he fails to kill luc . sadly , his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier : the return into anything better than a below - average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight - to - video .", "\" america ' s sweethearts \" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn ' t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be . almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co - script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co - hosting \" comic relief \" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self - indulgence ) . crystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous . \" america ' s sweethearts \" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters . it ' s a promising set - up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation . by the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed . john cusack and catherine zeta - jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp . of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $ 100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled \" time over time , \" are far from rosy . while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen ' s solo films have tanked . to make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a \" visionary \" who purchased the unabomber ' s cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket . desperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation . lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation . he enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen ' s sister , personal assistant and whipping girl . what lee doesn ' t know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness . press junkets are a haven for control freaks . studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand . generally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel . the next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews . every 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things . the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets . representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions . they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges . the \" reporters \" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs . placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit . the junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas . for most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press . when they do deal with journalists , the \" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters \" premise is de - clawed . gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions . lee certainly isn ' t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids . is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ? hell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie . all of which underscores how billy crystal and co - writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in \" america ' s sweethearts \" is based on barely - in - control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn ' t matter because any publicity is good publicity . and thus the very set - up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter . so what about the cast ? julia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) . catherine zeta - jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic . by casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on \" comic relief \" - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks . in supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed \" too broad . \" seth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with . come to think of it , \" little to work with \" is the operative phrase for this movie . as a hollywood satire , \" america ' s sweethearts \" is toothless . as a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure . such a good cast , such a waste of their efforts . had it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been \" much ado about nothing . \"", "note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . be forewarned . like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent . a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking . the film follows a soft - spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop . as boogie nights opens , he ' s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity . recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar . wholeheartedly embraced by jack ' s troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his \" one special thing \" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a \" big bright shining star \" . his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in . the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious . from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson ' s accomplished command of the camera is without question . while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self - congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco ' s unforgettable perpetual - motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent . it ' s a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker ' s career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it ' s somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he ' s clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he ' s borrowing from some of the best , and it ' s entirely effective within the context of this film . while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it ' s also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour . the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre - aids - scare period in american history where uninhibited , free - wheeling lifestyles abounded . while much of the film ' s humour pertains to the characters ' obliviousness of now - outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part - time salesman buck swope ' s demo of a stereo system with an eight - track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get ' freaky deaky ' with the music -- it ' s elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous . a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie / dirk ' s bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking . ably supported by a well - selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson ' s personal collection ) , there ' s a clear affection for the era in boogie nights . it ' s the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film ' s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters . after the debacle with 1996 ' s milos forman film , the people vs . larry flynt , another finely - crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography - related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public . however , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it ' s hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there ' s very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business . the glimpses on the sets of jack horner ' s shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there ' s a candid matter - of - factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it ' s refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided . if anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves . jack horner ' s dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) . in both films , the world of quickie low - budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack ' s retort of \" there are shadows in light , baby \" to his cinematographer ' s complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood ' s \" it ' s not about the little details , it ' s about the big picture ! \" rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false . in boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers ' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there ' s nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an ' artistic ' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark . much like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double - edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes \" this is the best work i ' ve ever done \" , it ' s genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness . mr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter . while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn ' t any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film ' s characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film ' s * protagonist * literally doesn ' t say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it ' s no wonder why the playfully inane \" how much can you bench ? \" banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film ' s finest exchanges . and while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it ' s problematic that some of the the threads given to the film ' s characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore ' s child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv - movie version of her character ' s story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions . still , even if he doesn ' t always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self - destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same . in any case , it ' s hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best - executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose - cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it ' s a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger ' s \" sister christian \" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard . if this scene already wasn ' t tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness . there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights . mr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect . similarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver ' s seat , sobbing \" i ' m so stupid \" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver ' s seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening . boogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good . while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention . mr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard ' s georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film . i ' m not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee . mr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it ' s wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation . worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead - on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track \" you got the touch \" in a vain attempt at a musical career . mr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective . ms . graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry . consequently , it ' s a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet - faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she ' s lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come - hither look , all one can do is gulp . her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she ' s essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity . ( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! ) and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham ' s parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant ' s drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet . draw your own conclusions . perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion . his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it ' s no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry . while the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle ' s eyes makes the scene unforgettable . luis guzman ' s most famous work is possibly in brian de palma ' s carlito ' s way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good - natured nightclub owner who ' s a hanger - on to jack ' s group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures . jack ' s eventual acquiescence to maurice ' s request leads to one of boogie nights ' biggest comic payoffs . boogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work . striking a fine balance between humour and drama , and exceptionally well - crafted , there ' s no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year .", "all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre - release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood . ultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996 ' s other , underperforming disaster films ( dante ' s peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year . but , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank . no number of name changes can help this picture . it ' s not just about a disaster , it is a disaster . hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute . the best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises . the community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud - choked skies . from that moment on , it ' s all downhill . whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point . it takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest - seeming 95 - minute motion pictures i have recently endured . basically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot - outs . there ' s a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions . it ' s all very routine and uninteresting because there aren ' t any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense . the film ' s conclusion is so preposterous that it ' s almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around . action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion . graham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle . unfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer - turned - director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it . the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition . we see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot - outs , etc . -- over and over again . the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length . the storyline gives us a number of paper - thin characters in contrived circumstances . there ' s tom ( christian slater ) , the one - dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash . he and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv ' s \" lou grant \" ) , get stuck on a street that ' s rapidly turning into a river . a group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers . after charlie is killed in a shoot - out , tom hides the money , then runs . as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg ' s roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would - be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily - corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives . there isn ' t any real acting in this film . christian slater utters a few lame one - liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera . tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen . randy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing . morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script . freeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time - to - time . following in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn ' t trust nature ' s fury as the chief engine of conflict . as a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys / bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had . titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water . hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible . thus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) . fortunately , there are only two elements left .", "plot : a rich guy who doesn ' t believe in love , orders a mail - order bride for himself . that very evening , the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter . but what ' s this ? one of them might not be the person they are pretending to be ? wow . . . a sin , indeed . critique : easily one of the worst movies that i ' ve seen all year . too long , too boring , too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching a good movie . what the hell were they thinking when they made this thing ? ( it ' s no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year ) this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week , with some nudity stuffed in from time to time , just to wake up the audience . have you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies , one that you just couldn ' t help but switch back to from time to time , just to make sure that it wasn ' t part of some sick joke ? well , this movie is exactly like that , only it isn ' t a joke , it isn ' t on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it ! ! i say again . . . what the shite were they thinking ? okay , so where do i start ? first of all , the trailer of this film gives away the movie ' s main plot twist , the betrayal . so for the first half hour of the film , you ' re basically just sitting there , watching these two \" lovers \" go through the motions until the \" betrayal \" occurs . whoopee , big surprise . second of all , angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part . why ? well , it ' s like this : not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman ! i mean , it ' s like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining , well , the same goes here . every look in jolie ' s eyes screams \" psycho \" ! then of course , you have the case of the \" patsy \" husband , a man who just can ' t seem to figure out anything in time . i mean . . . how boring is that for the audience ? you ' re watching this guy screw up time after time after time , and somehow , we ' re supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude . no , thanks ! and if we don ' t care about him , and we really don ' t care about her ( she ' s a beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film ) , who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film ? well , i ' ll tell you . the only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not i ' d actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled . no suspense , no chemistry between the leads , no real love or passion , no sense of surprise , plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending . so why am i even giving this film a rating of three points ? well , it ' s actually pretty simple . i liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score , but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolie ' s boobies ( that ' s two points right there ! ) and another one for antonio ' s ass ( hairless , just for the record ) . everything else in this movie was pointless , boring and just plain stupid . try imagining a soft - porn movie . . . but without the plot ! that ' s pretty much what you ' ve got here . a low point in the careers of both stars . oops , i almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue . . . god oh mighty . . . make it stop ! ! where ' s joblo coming from ? american psycho ( 9 / 10 ) -

paid passes ) . if there ' s ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non - stop action , the james bond films are it . and if there ' s ever been a james bond film that not only proves this , but does so by pushing it to the extreme , \" tomorrow never dies \" is it . opening sequences almost always make or break action films . when done properly , not only are they actually exciting , but they foreshadow things to come . this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie , but with a sense of the self - aware , enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in . first there ' s a high - tech , slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly , chinese waters . there ' s definite tension as there seems to be an unknown , but certainly hostile , third party involved who is manipulating both sides . when the scene ends in tragedy , it ' s clear there ' s some kind of powerful conspiracy going on , and who else to call on for such a case but james bond ? the film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond ( brosnon ) . as the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious , bond is clearly ( and obviously ) depicted as an out - and - out hero . he single - handedly takes out a small army of terrorists , and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co - pilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down ! this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for ( over - ) using , but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly . it ' s not about the payoff because it ' s obvious bond will escape , instead , it ' s the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it , all the while creating for witty , hysterical comedy . it seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore , because of political correctness , and just plain copping - out on behalf of the filmmakers ( even the term \" villain \" sounds passe ) . what the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come , yet making him seem completely plausible . jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant , cunning elliot carver , a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world , that is , through his massive media empire , not through nuclear weapons . through some interesting detective work , bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news . not only is that an original idea for a conflict , but one which could carry over into reality . surprisingly , this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become . the film ' s hook is the action , and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way . the story works much like bond himself - always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot . somehow a chinese agent , wai lin ( yeoh ) , bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together . the chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid , but also works because of this , not in spite of it . the two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons , yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story . although \" tomorrow never dies \" is far from perfect , it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue .", "14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds . in 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross - country journey with the destination of wally world , a world - renowned theme park in california . we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured . two years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them . now , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die . they ' ve been cremated . vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill - fated father of two . the premise is basically the same . clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas . his wife ellen ( beverly d ' angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick . of course a \" vacation \" movie wouldn ' t be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times . there isn ' t too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it . it ' s really just a skit movie . there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know . the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit . the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes . vegas vacation comes off like the first . a good example of the latter would be last year ' s black sheep . the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn ' t really fit into a movie mold . in these cases , a \" plot \" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i . e . have a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie ) . such is the case with this movie ' s mini - plots . clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold ' s money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d ' lyn ) as an exotic dancer . the simple fact is : this movie isn ' t funny . at first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped . chase plays clark griswold really well . he made the character and he is the character . d ' angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn ' t show any signs of redemption . as for the two new griswold kids , the word \" blah \" comes to mind . the \" vacation \" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them . they ' re so generic , you ' ll expect the credits to read \" girl # 1 as audrey griswold \" . vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor . yes , it ' s true that vegas vacation isn ' t even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart . first off , why did they leave off the national lampoon ' s heading on the title ? i couldn ' t find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn ' t want to be associated with such a lame film . that ' s saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they ' d be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn ' t . there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact . the first three films in the \" vacation \" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80 ' s including mr . mom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller ' s day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck . wowzers ! what a r ? sum ? ! looking at the names , you ' d think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980 ' s . well that ' s not all . this guy also brought us 90 ' s hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber . vegas vacation , however , didn ' t have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious . this time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made - for - tv movies . vegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made - for - tv sequel . if this sounds like a wild idea , it ' s not . revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it . vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m . sunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it ' s quite out of place . stephen kessler ' s jejune direction doesn ' t help things either . he only makes the film even more tv - movie - ish . each consecutive \" vacation \" movie has suffered a drop in directing power . we started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co - writing ghostbusters . not too bad . then we had national lampoon ' s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who ' s talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high . lastly we had national lampoon ' s christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s . chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon . kessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 . granted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal . if you loved the \" vacation \" movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still isn ' t anything here worth seeing . if you loved them , don ' t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte . if you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ?", "one year has passed since the last time we saw them , and but wayne campbell and garth algar are back but , they ' ve moved out of their parents homes , and now have their own pad in an abandoned warehouse . wayne ' s still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend , cassandra , and of course garth is still having his own , personal growing pains . they guys are just finishing off one of their shows , and head off to an aerosmith concert where they run across cassandra and her new manager , a stereotypical industry slime not unlike the character rob lowe portrayed in the previous film . again , the promoter is not only after the money that cassandra ' s talent can bring in . the storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of the original , \" guy loses chick , guy realizes mistake , and guy gets chick back . \" fortunately , there is more to this movie than this somewhat sheer plot . the wit and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent and fresh with many inside jokes on the film and music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes of wayne and garth showing their true color . highlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park , garth ' s seduction by a married woman , a surprise appearance by charleton heston , a 1960 ' s batman setup in the guy ' s pad , and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison and some \" naked indian guy , \" an unexpected lip - sync of ymca ( you could see that one coming a mile away ) and of course a hilarious parody of those badly - dubbed kung - fu movies we love to laugh at . and if you ' ve ever wondered why there ' s always boxes of watermelons , chickens , and people walking plate glass in the middle of streets , you ' ll find out here . this movie also explores wayne and garth a little more . garth has somewhat of a \" coming of age \" and wayne gets to learn a little about himself ( with a little help from our old friend , jim morrison ) . a few old jokes from the previous movie are explored here again , but this time with a few twists to keep them fresh , and luckily , few , if any of them are overused . overall , the movie has plenty of continuity flaws ( especially in the fight scent between garth and cassandra ' s dad ) , but these are easily overlooked as this is , after wayne ' s world . the plot is flimsy but manageable . there are a few special effects , but they are fairly seamless , and fill nicely into the plot . the acting is good , for this sort of movie , but there are some very bright spots . in the big picture , this movie is just plain fun . there is lots of intelligent humor that makes this film special . during the whole one hour and 40 minutes , i didn ' t even think about looking at my watch a single time . silly , but riotous at times , this is an excellent movie even better than the original .", "last summer , a feature - length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning . based on the famous 60 ' s television show , the film was an enormous box - office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west . but it sounded promising : the same tag - team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again . and co - star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects . i mean , what could possibly go wrong ? the answer is just about everything . wild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate . there are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression . but the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it . at square one , we have a bizarre case of casting . will smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series . my guess regarding the casting of african - american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved . smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him . he ' s too much of a joker . i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible . what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self - assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office . the plot involves west and cross - dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists . the trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent . loveless has taken the country ' s top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns . one such weapon is an 80 - foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right . the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer - generated imagery with the western surroundings . unfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film ' s plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem . wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works . most of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival . if it ' s one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it ' s the performances , and even they are mostly off - kilter and poorly delivered . kline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot . salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon . branagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film . but even he is so utterly weird and over - the - top . rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is . i suppose there ' s always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big - budget release that manages to completely disappoint . wild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 . but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office . perhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith ' s name stamped on a summer movie . after such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume .", "while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks . and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year . the trend of the moment -- and bear in mind it ' s a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you ' ve seen the animated series on hbo you ' ll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he ' s been sent to hell . todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else . not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while . every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student . the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life . al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent / assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue - in - cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him . the next element in the film is the part when things go awry . and as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al . as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene . inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away . hence , jason ' s mischievous master - mind plan , to ` conquer the world \" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil ' s army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again . so , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol ' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife . time passes . and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . . this character is merely a poor man ' s obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla . now the stage is set spawn , the new ` enemy of evil ' vs evil . and evil takes the cake , doubtlessly . john leguizamo ' s deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film ' s relief point . all this anguish , pain , half - baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so - so one liners . and then there ' s martin sheen . whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years . his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent . as the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b - movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot . this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street . i ' d never thought i ' d be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen ' s career is in better shape . spawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable . for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better . it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie -- a very bad superhero movie . continually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made . perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry . the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible . the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting . it is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton ' s batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act . but bruce wayne had human elements to him . he was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human . the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he ' s fatigued about being normal . and as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary . none of this is present in spawn . the fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny - dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner ' s . as an example of this film ' s vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic . admittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that ' s when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum . it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature . besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn . movies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to . and kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one . children are not muppets . and spawn unapologetically targets children .", "plot : a rich psychiatrist with a great home life gets his cute daughter kidnapped by some bad guys who want him to extract some information from the mind of one of his nutty patients . of course , the patient is not cooperative and the doctor only has a few hours to comply with their demands , before they kill his daughter . pretty good premise , no ? critique : if you ' re not a fan of movies packed with plot holes , inconsistencies and yes , even more plot holes , heed my words and skip this hollow thriller . and i don ' t like saying that either , since this film actually had some potential and started off pretty well . sure , the story is basically just an amalgamation of ransom , primal fear and nick of time pureed into one , but the whole \" psychiatrist working against the clock \" thing , actually had me engaged at first . but it ' s at about the halfway mark of this movie , that the bottom drops out and all that we ' re left with are a lot of questions and very few plausible answers . we get the overly smart kid who manages to \" pull one \" over on the bad guys . we get a weak woman with her leg in a cast beating the crap out of a tough bad guy . we get douglas ' character , a new york uppedity psychiatrist , suddenly turning into an action hero , with moves and attitude to boot . and what about the film ' s main plot point ? why would the bad guys still give a crap about this thing after 10 years , and even more so , why would they only give the shrink until the day ' s end to do his part ? ( you waited 10 years , what ' s another few days ? - or why not set up another heist instead ? ) . i ' ll tell you why , it ' s because we wouldn ' t have a ( bad ) movie otherwise , that ' s why ! and many , many more . ugh , whatever the case , it was just about the time that douglas ' character suddenly removed murphy ' s character from the mental home ( and how come she went with him so nicely ? i thought she didn ' t trust him ) , that i turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into a joke . and a few bogus chase and action sequences later , we were left with a long - winded ending that did little to answer any other questions i might ' ve still had , and actually brought up even more contradictions . badly put together , this movie features some decent acting , some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise , but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you with little care for anyone . in fact , if it wasn ' t for brittany murphy ' s excellent portrayal of a traumatized teen , jennifer esposito ' s embarrassing performance as a police woman ( yeah , right ! watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick - but it wasn ' t supposed to be ) and michael douglas ' cool \" regular guy \" part , there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture . incidentally , can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito ' s character was in this movie in the first place ? she was completely superfluous . and on top of all that , by the end of this flick , the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most of the garbage that he ' d been shoveling out for the hour and a half prior , and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back to an earlier character ' s death when one of the bad guys dies , just so we know ( as an audience ) , that the two are interrelated somehow . ooooh , thanks , mr . fleder . . . i appreciate the spoon - feeding , dude . . . yum , yum . . . but how about explaining every other plot point in your film that made no sense ? whatever . either way , i don ' t give a rat ' s ass because this movie is a dog and that ' s unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it . see it if you like dumb thrillers . incidentally , if you appreciated along came a spider , you will likely enjoy this film as well . they both start off with interesting premises , only to toss all logic and sense out the window about halfway through . where ' s joblo coming from ? along came a spider ( 4 / 10 ) - girl , interrupted ( 5 / 10 ) - kiss the girls ( 7 / 10 ) - primal fear ( 7 / 10 ) -- seven ( 10 / 10 )", "under any other circumstances , i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review . however , in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary . even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk . the movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm ' s past patients . distraught , the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself . cut to the \" next fall \" , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i didn ' t want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument ) . after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has \" the sixth sense \" , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead . and this , as they say , is where the healing begins . the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert ' s colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of \" siskel and ebert \" ) . although i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i ' ve always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one . here , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film ' s conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i ' ve fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated . and indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment . stripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion . after seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power . it ' s a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature - length movie . in fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth - shattering revelation that is yet to come . and when the final moments do come , it ' s a huge letdown ; the end makes no sense at all . it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level . i won ' t go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder . now , in all fairness , i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be ) had it not been revealed to me before hand . however , i feel very confident that i , as well as anyone who had seen a few \" twilight zone \" episodes , would have seen it coming a mile away . the fact that movie - goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped . ironically , to fully appreciate the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl ' s funeral ) , the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy . i wouldn ' t have even known about this mental disease if i hadn ' t , by pure dumb luck , caught \" dateline nbc \" the other week when they did a feature story on it . despite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment ( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace ? ) , in the end , the sixth sense is too chalk - full of contradictions and just isn ' t plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation .", "lisa cholodenko ' s \" high art , \" is an intelligent , quiet drama . its strongest quality , aside from the top - notch central performances , is the perceptive way in which the film , also written by cholodenko , observes its characters . they are all flawed people , some more troubled than others , but they are not judged . judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers ' parts , because no one , no matter how bad off they are , deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they cannot break free of . syd ( radha mitchell ) , a 24 - year - old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james ( gabriel mann ) , has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high - profile photography magazine , \" frame . \" she very much enjoys where her career is headed , but is often not taken very seriously by her managers , who are always giving her petty jobs to do , when she knows she could be doing more important things . one night , while taking a bath , syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers , so when she goes up there to inform them of it , she meets lucy beliner ( ally sheedy ) , a thin , worn - out , and unhappy woman , who lives with her drug - addicted german girlfriend , greta ( patricia clarkson ) , a pathetic former actress who is usually so out - of - it that she often is in and out of conciousness . syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy , and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before . lucy claims she doesn ' t want to get back into the profession , but syd manages to convince the \" frame \" editors to do a piece on her work . all the while , syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy , even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman , and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons . \" high art , \" is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger - coated or idealized , but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere , while syd ' s luck begins to rise . the film in no way is about lesbianism , but about love , which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality . as lucy and syd grow closer and closer together , we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other , even if the relationship might be doomed . with this picture , ally sheedy ' s star has risen once again , thanks to her touching , nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy , a woman who , in the course of a decade , has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs , which has taken away her once - blossoming career . her characted really is tragic , and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother , in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem , and her mother matter - of - factly responds by saying she can ' t help her , is heartbreaking . although not autobiographical , sheedy has had drug problems in her past , and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy ' s footsteps to her role . also very good is radha mitchell as syd , who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy , \" love and other catastrophes , \" wh caught me by surprise with her performance . easily being able to pass as christina ricci ' s older sister , mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently . as accurate as almost every detail is in , \" high art , \" i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james , who , played by gabriel mann , is left with a throwaway role . by the time he finds out about syd and lucy , he disappears from the film , and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other . this is a very minor fault , however , in a film that is full of riches . although many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair , syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems . the character of dominique ( anh duong ) , the \" frame \" editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas , was also written to be far more mature than expected . and the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done . for once , it did not invlove steaminess , or violent sexual activity , or gratuitous nudity , but focused on the actual characters , who love each other , and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex . \" high art , \" which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival , marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko , as well as sheedy ' s strongest , and best , role to date .", "in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \\ professor with such lived - in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid - 80 ' s . in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . you ' d think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good - natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open . in wonder boys his performance isn ' t showy or a tour de force , it ' s simple yet truthful . he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes . grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map . when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms . grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy . their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for . leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions . he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges . he ' s portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated . he reminds me of the self - imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) . whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white . leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth . tobey maguire fits well in the role . with his round , sweet - eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude . but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he ' s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady ' s pants . this is a plot line i had trouble with . douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it ' s because i ' m jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas ' s real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i ' m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . there is a movie in there somewhere . grady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . okay , maybe not so chivalrous . there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , \" she was a junkie for the printed word . lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice \" . robert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . he ' s arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . the actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . i wish wonder boys had more of him . searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that ' s part of its charm . and maybe i ' m a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i ' m greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . everyone has a sub - genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . i ' m privy to films about literary types i . e . those individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . sometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that ' s a problem i wish i found with films more often . another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low - key comedy for its chuckle - worthy throwaway gags . the gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn ' t ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . curtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin ' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . it ' s the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . many will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties .", "as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan ' s latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . but also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . once again , chan ' s screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star ' s character simply jackie , with no last name . this jackie is a world - class chef who co - hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . of course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter ' s ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . other plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . the sole purpose of mr . nice guy ' s existence are chan ' s comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . director samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan ' s , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head - on into a wild chase / fight / shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . other impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late - film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw . none of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop ' s thrilling helicopter - train finale or rumble in the bronx ' s daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively . but the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film ' s end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan ' s athletic prowess ) . filmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english - speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan ' s latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill - fated attempts with 1980 ' s the big brawl and 1985 ' s the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co - starring chris tucker . hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before .", "i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film . i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , \" it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach . throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof ! we ' ll have a hit on our hands ! \" the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one - dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography . the story is loosely based around the pro football players ' strike in 1987 and a rag - tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels . keanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has - been football college player looking for redemption . gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers . rounding out the cast includes swingers ' jon favreau , 7 - up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders . this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny ' s . the usual things happen like clockwork . the hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax . it ' s also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks . howard deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of ' 80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes . obviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end . sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life . the replacements offers none of this .", "a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip - hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today ' s youth seem attracted to black culture . the review if black & white , the new film from writer / director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act . however , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that . black & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america ' s youth and hip - hop culture without getting heavy - handed overly serious . featuring a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr . ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback ' s is a complex film worth seeing . black & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman . there is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game . this eventually spills over into the life of dean ' s long - time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem . rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white - owned club on his turf . meanwhile , the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr . ) . others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will , joe pantoliano as his district attorney father , jared leto as a high school teacher , marla maples as the mother of one of hip - hop crazed teens , claudia schiffer as dean ' s girlfriend , and mike tyson as . . . mike tyson . the stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time . friendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence . originally rated nc - 17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls . while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing . the three - way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for , and several audience members got up and left at that point . the frequent sex is one of the film ' s few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film . to toback ' s credit , the level of violence in black & white is almost nil . these gangstas and hip - hop artists are given real problems and concerns , and only become gun - toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way . whenever a character finds himself on donager ' s handheld digital camera , he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence , but not everyone has fully bought into the idea . charlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip - hop , but admits that \" in ten years time , i ' ll be way over this . \" these youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it . toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny . most of the humour comes from mike tyson , who provides the film ' s comic relief without really trying . he is given big words like vernacular to say , and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson , he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better , playing on tyson ' s image as a dimwit . but tyson also gets the film ' s scariest moment . as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry , tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm . the scene is entirely improvised , with downey jr . being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction . the reaction he gets , being slapped and then choked is astonishing , as downey jr ' s face turns a frightening shade of purple . black & white is a film about hip - hop culture , and the film ' s omnipresent hip - hop soundtrack strongly supports this . but toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does , toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character ' s struggle . thus black & white ' s message about hip - hop becomes secondary to the film itself . toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip - hop along the way . and we do .", "when walt disney pictures announced a live - action feature based on the ' 60s cartoon series of \" mr . magoo , \" special interests groups representing the vision -

blind , it ' s an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity . it ' s stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas . look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you ' ll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr . magoo . the best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining . the worst , mr . magoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be . the first problem with mr . magoo is the script . despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr . magoo is comically barren . from beginning to end , there ' s not a laugh to be found . every attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud . you ' d think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that ' s not the case . i ' ve had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures . then there ' s leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character ( memorably voiced by jim backus ) . in the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun . lately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr . magoo . even if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we ' re reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but \" top form \" is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here . this is strictly a take - the - money - and - run operation . the story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber . the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often . the bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts - type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed ) . matt keeslar portrays one of magoo ' s sidekicks -- his nephew , waldo . the bumbling man ' s other , more interesting companion is a dog named angus . most of mr . magoo ' s humor comes in the form of failed slapstick . the cartoon violence level in this film doesn ' t approach that of home alone 3 or flubber , but it ' s still pretty acute , with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices . there ' s a non - violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better , but , compared to mr . bean ' s recent , similar misadventure , it doesn ' t hold up well . then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo ' s near blindness , such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby . i ' m willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack . tong , a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market , has helmed several jackie chan movies , including first strike , rumble in the bronx , and supercop . his chief talent , that of choreographing martial arts fights , is wasted here ( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch ) . like john woo ( hard target ) and ringo lam ( maximum risk ) before him , it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream . it is worth noting that , unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under - 10 crowd while driving parents to distraction , mr . magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages . the screening i attended was wall - to - wall kids , and , for the most part , they didn ' t seem to be enjoying themselves . when the film was over , i asked one little girl what she thought of it . her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words . mr . magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer , sight unseen .", "this well - conceived but ultra sugary coming - of - age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion . joseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10 - year - old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer . loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup . the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical . the beals , the father ( denis leary ) and his wife ( dana delany ) , are both successful doctors ; julia stiles plays joshua ' s older sister , needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him . this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven , but living in south philadelphia , sending their children to a well - run catholic school . joshua , the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn , is a handsome , sweet , intelligent , friendly , and endearing child , who does well in school , relates to the nuns and priests , and talks politely to his well - meaning parents . all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch . the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather , who promised to be with him forever . his answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that ' s just the way it is , sometimes . this search for god takes us nowhere because , as his friend david ( reifsnyder ) says , where can you look for him if he doesn ' t exist . now , that ' s a smart kid . but joseph looks for him in the usual places , and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends . one of his teachers is the kind - hearted sister terry ( rosie o ' donnell ) , who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball , making him the clean - up hitter , and in my opinion , if she wasn ' t a big tv star , would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher , she is that convincing . throughout the film , she is saved from answering any tough ( sic ! ) question about god by the bell , as it rings to end the class . nothing much happens in the search for god , there is no parody of the catholic school ; though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god , but this is gentle stuff , no real criticism or search for god is attempted . what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum , which is designed not to upset anyone , as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real , live angel , a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody - goody . the film ends as this angel ( ! ! ! ) tells him his grandfather is all right . his quest is ended , as apparently angels don ' t have wings and are approachable ; and god , well , . . . maybe that ' s for another film down the road . this part of the film was the final straw for me , i couldn ' t swallow any more goo . as this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose . though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts , this director is loaded with hokum , all he has learned how to do , is hide the hokum better . well , god bless him , if he can do that . this is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood . it ' s just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death , children in a parochial elementary school , or for that matter , about god . and that family of his , they ' re too good for words . yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place . for those who want to see something soft , without a bite to it , this is the one .", "susan granger ' s review of \" session 9 \" ( usa films ) sometimes you just get more than your bargained for . . . like when boston - based hazmat elimination , run by scottish actor peter mullan and his trusty assistant , david caruso , assures a town engineer ( paul guilifoyle ) that they can remove insidious asbestos fibers from a victorian hospital facility in a week . erected in 1871 , deserted and decomposing since 1985 , the danvers mental hospital , is one of the most malevolent \" locations \" ever chosen for a film . the structure is so massive - with its labyrinth of rubble - strewn corridors , collapsing floors , stagnant pools of water , isolation cells , and ominous surgical chambers where experimental pre - frontal lobotomies were performed - that their task seems impossible within that time frame . and each member of their inexperienced crew ( stephan gevedon , brandon sexton iii , and josh lucas ) is coping with his own personal demons as , one by one , their minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in which they ' re working . the film ' s title is derived from salvaged reel - to - reel audio - recorded sessions involving the demonic possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities . by the time session 9 occurs so do dreadful disasters . filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsaw - massacre - type ghost story but the script lacks structure and isn ' t particularly scary . the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing . on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" session 9 \" is a dark , gloomy 4 . silly me . . . at first , i thought that the original name of the danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference to mrs . danvers , the creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson in alfred hitchcock ' s truly terrifying \" rebecca \" that also involved a cavernous mansion called manderley .", "if only austin powers : the spy who shagged me had been just half as original , zany , silly and totally enjoyable as its predecessor , it would have easily been one of this summer ' s biggest pleasures . if only . in fact , the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original ; instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another , the filmmakers bombard us with used - up , tired jokes taken directly from the first one . take the scene where austin powers ( again played by mike myers , but with only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously ) confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff . after being pushed off the ravine , the bad guy is of course assumed dead . but suddenly , we hear a pleading voice coming from down below ; he ' s only injured . a similar scene played very well in the original international man of mystery , but here i was insulted by it . did the filmmakers really believe the audience would laugh at a rip - off ? apparently i overestimated the intelligence of the average movie - goer , considering that the film has pulled in over $ 200 million in domestic theatrical grosses alone . do i hear the sound of a franchise heading our way ? having said that , though , i still cannot deny the film its merits . the basic plot was delightfully silly enough to sustain my interest somewhat ; dr . evil ( mike myers , in the second of his three roles ) , having constructed a time machine , goes back to the year 1969 in an attempt to snatch austin power ' s \" mojo \" ( don ' t you just love that word ? ) whilst he is cryogenically frozen . when austin gets wind of this ( after a great intro explaining the absence of elizabeth hurley ' s vanessa kensington ) , he too travels back in time to re - claim his sexual drive , accompanied by the hot - to - trot felicity shagwell , played by heather graham . this sounds stupid , i know , but in the movie it starts to make some kind of weird , off - the - wall sense , and it worked for me . then there ' s mini - me ( verne troyer ) , a . . . petite clone of myer ' s dr . evil , exactly 1 / 8 in size . troyer ' s persona alone gains the film an extra half - star , contributing to one particularly hilarious scene where he attempts to nibble on his own mini - mr . bigglesworth . just try to ignore the fact that , at 2 ' 8 '' , he would make dr . evil ' s height rise to just over 21 feet . no matter . however , there are only about four hearty laughs throughout the entire hour and a half ( the most notable being the now infamous tent scene ) , and that just isn ' t enough to warrant even a minor recommendation . if there is in fact an \" austin powers 3 \" , they should just kill off secret agent powers and put the emphasis on dr . evil and mini - me . unconventional , yes , but there ' s no denying that it ' d make for a better movie .", "in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather . was it \" deep \" ? nope . however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up . it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was \" without the comic book uplift \" of the indiana jones and superman pictures . which was true . if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man ' s escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place . if those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn . some critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ; mr . lovell gave it * * * 1 / 2 and wrote that \" this is batman as batman should be . \" ; mr . travers called it one of the ten best films of the year . the praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect . there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton . the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes . the villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman ' s nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman ' s body she gets pushed off a building . i admire mr . burton for trying to do more then entertain , but the result is a mess . nothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten . hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast . alas , these are only hints . there are , don ' t misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis . a weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing .", "in a flashback , the teenage girl in the eccentric family in the canadian film , the hanging garden , tells her senile grandmother that she is going to a school dance . horrified , the grandmother wants to know if her granddaughter knows \" the rule of 6 . \" if you don ' t break off a kiss by the count of 6 , then you committed a sin with the boy . and most of all , the grandmother wants to know if she has \" protection ? \" she must carry a rosary in her pocket at all times . the richly acted film is written and directed by thom fitzgerald in a quirky but loving style . although some may refer to the film as yet another dysfunctional family picture , that moniker misses the mark . yes , every member of the household has their own special problems , but the writer didn ' t choose to name so many characters for various flowers by accident . this delightful little picture mixes love , tragedy and pathos , resulting in a hopeful and almost magical concoction . during the opening credits we observe the boy , sweet william , at the center of the story . first , he ' s an average sized young lad who is slapped off - screen by his father . next , he ' s 300 pound teenager , played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte . when the opening credits end , we cut to 10 years later . william is now an average - sized , reasonably happy adult , played with love and compassion by chris leavins . william has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his free - spirited and foul - mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover , fletcher ( joe s . keller ) . kerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy . nicole burnell , who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter , plays the teenage rosemary . the father of the family , whiskey mac ( peter macneill ) , is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful . his wife , iris ( seana mckenna ) , says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids . rounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine - year - old violet , the sister whom william meets for the first time . as the exuberant irish music fills the air at the wedding in the family home , william wanders off to try on one of his old coats , which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self . the director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways . he takes a common wedding dress train and uses it to set up scenes in fresh and fascinating ways . rosmary ' s trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated , and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath , all while talking to her brother . as much as anything , the film is a series of character sketches . in one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter , a homosexual one . although he is perfectly happy liking the same sex , his mother is aghast . a woman friend of hers suggests she take william to a local housewife , dusty miller ( martha irving ) , who , for a fee , will have heterosexual sex with william . with absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch without being sensational . dusty , after asking iris to watch her daughter , takes william and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex . all of this notwithstanding , he still prefers males . the film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes face - to - face with himself when younger . this causes his ugly old memories to be reignited . in the most devastating , he has to come to grips with his former self who was so overwhelmed with the stress that he tried to hang himself . even here , the director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker . the ultimate result is an uplifting story that has more hope that one would ever expect from the outline of its plot . the hanging garden runs 1 : 31 . it is rated r for strong sexuality , language , violence and some teen drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old and mature .", "arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts , since the late 80 ' s , but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one - liners are getting worse . it ' s hard seeing arnold as mr . freeze in batman and robin , especially when he says tons of ice jokes , but hey he got 15 million , what ' s it matter to him ? once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster , that can ' t compare with the likes of the terminator series , true lies and even eraser . in this so called dark thriller , the devil ( gabriel byrne ) has come upon earth , to impregnate a woman ( robin tunney ) which happens every 1000 years , and basically destroy the world , but apparently god has chosen one man , and that one man is jericho cane ( arnold himself ) . with the help of a trusty sidekick ( kevin pollack ) , they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world ! parts of this are actually so absurd , that they would fit right in with dogma . yes , the film is that weak , but it ' s better than the other blockbuster right now ( sleepy hollow ) , but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film . anyway , this definitely doesn ' t seem like an arnold movie . it just wasn ' t the type of film you can see him doing . sure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known one - liners , but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going . it ' s understandable , especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources . aside form that , he still walked through it , much like he has in the past few films . i ' m sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days . speaking of action , where was it in this film ? there was hardly any explosions or fights . the devil made a few places explode , but arnold wasn ' t kicking some devil butt . the ending was changed to make it more spiritual , which undoubtedly ruined the film . i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred , but once again i was let down . i also don ' t know why the film took so long and cost so much . there was really no super affects at all , unless you consider an invisible devil , who was in it for 5 minutes tops , worth the overpriced budget . the budget should have gone into a better script , where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom . it ' s pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie . do they even read these things anymore ? it sure doesn ' t seem like it . thankfully gabriel ' s performance gave some light to this poor film . when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney , you can ' t help but feel that he looked like a devil . the guy is creepy looking anyway ! when it ' s all over , you ' re just glad it ' s the end of the movie . don ' t bother to see this , if you ' re expecting a solid action flick , because it ' s neither solid nor does it have action . it ' s just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing , due to a strategic marketing campaign . save your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience .", "senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a one - joke concept a bit too far . director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this , having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies . marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon , a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage . however , he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition , scott thorpe ( david spade , in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep ) : an athletic record , sponsorship by a fraternity , and , most of all , a wealthy family to back him up . in fact , darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet . but there may be a light at the end of that tunnel . he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university ' s dr . wheedon ( brad dourif ) . as a result , his senses are magnified tenfold . using his newfound abilities , he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job ( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side - effects to having super senses ) . naturally , marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle , giving jim carrey - ish amounts of physical humor . the problem is , aside from a few genuinely inspired bits , there ' s not much that ' s funny here . the film has it ' s one central gag , and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor . there obviously wasn ' t much thought put into the plot . the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous . i mean , why the emphasis on extra - curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single - elimination quiz anyhow ? and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester ? to give it credit , senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl ' s roommate , tim laflour ( matthew lillard ) . apparently , he is supposed to be faddish , but the film never does anything with him , leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie . his \" intervention \" scenes with darryl , however , do provide a rare , and welcome , laugh . and then there ' s the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one . in this case , the object of darryl ' s amor is janice ( tamara taylor ) , a fellow student who won ' t have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super - senses . needless to say , the romance is completely extraneous , and adds little to the film . this is a film that desperately needed something else . be that a good plot , more jokes ( or simply funnier ones ) , or a strong character or two , anything would have helped senseless get off the ground . as it is , all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can ' t help marlon wayans get this one off the ground .", "being that it is a foreign language film with no known names with a select number theaters showing it , \" shall we dance \" won ' t be seen by that many people . and that ' s a shame - this is a funny , enchanting , and goofy movie full of laughs , surprises , and wonderful dance sequences . the surprising thing about \" shall we dance \" is the universal appeal of the story . a us version is in the works , and it ' s no wonder - it ' s not really all that culture specific . although there is a narrated set - up that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings ( about the view the japanese culture has about ballroom dancing ) , the movie is so rich in character and appeal that this added layer isn ' t at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film . the only important unexplained japanese - specific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is that 1000 yen is roughly $ 10 ( when you see the film - and you should see this film - you ' ll know why ) . a middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set for himself in life ( a house , a child , and good marriage ) still doesn ' t translate into a fulfilled life . after glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking out from a dance studio window while on the train home from work , sugiyana ( koji yakusho ) decides after some trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something in himself . after finding the weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant and beautiful mai ( tamiyo kusakari ) too rich for his blood , sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her . we then meet the players in this gem of a movie , who all have their own reasons for joining the class . later on , we meet aoki at the dance studio ( naoto takenaka ) , a co - worker and all out weirdo and one of the laugh riot highlights of the film . the story , laughs , and touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along . it ' s a pleasure to watch such a wonderful film that is propelled almost solely by the characters and performances . it ' s difficult to explain the charms of the film without revealing too much - the movie abounds with little revelations that subtly shape the characters , and in the end , each one is that much fuller and more understood by the time you leave the theater . it ' s one of those movies that only the french seem to make anymore - no big plot , no special effects , no gunplay , no tragic consequences , no forced examinations of the nature of love , and no insights into the nature of evil . just a warm , funny , endearing film that will charm the pants off of you . when was the last time you left a theater feeling all warm and fuzzy inside ? \" shall we dance \" will do that to you without any treacly aftertaste .", "one of kyle mclachlan ' s earlier cinematic features , this movie has had an obvious influence on such films as the terminator ( 8 / 10 ) , species ( 7 / 10 ) and the more recent , fallen with denzel washington . plot : a science -

paced , urban equivalent of the thing ( 8 / 10 ) , checks in on all cylinders for ultra - violence ( god knows how many people died in this movie ) , action and an overall rock ' n roll attitude . then again , how can you go wrong with an \" alien \" that likes the ferraris , guns , heavy metal music and sexy girls ? ! granted , the plot isn ' t the most elaborate of tales ( alien bad , find alien , kill alien ) , but i can honestly say that i was never once bored during the viewing of this entire picture . i wouldn ' t recommend it to those who don ' t like car chases , murders , and bland acting , but for all the rest of you out there , those who enjoy putting away their brains every now and again , sitting back , slamming back some salsa ' d nachos , and relishing in the cheeze some call film . . . have a blast ! ! two scenes to watch for are both within the first ten minutes of this gore -

in - marriage to the queen of normandy ( joan sims ) . she comes to england in the hope of marrying henry but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has a reeking garlic breath , he is totally averse to the idea of marriage . henry ' s court is very corrupt , with the cardinal ( terry scott ) trying to bribe cromwell ( kenneth williams ) and cromwell trying to bribe the king . there is a state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen ( sims ) in the tower of london ready for execution . the queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before , so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey , who has a rather lecherous character to play this time . the cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices ! owing to circumstances , sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and sometimes that he isn ' t . this is because of renewed threats by the king of france ( peter gilmore ) to come over himself , which in the end he does . by then , henry has found himself a new queen , played by none other than barbara windsor ! it looks like he has some explaining to do ! there are stand - out performances by sid james as henry , joan sims as marie , and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal . also there are cameos from kenneth connor and peter butterworth , who plays barbara ' s father . the set and costume design is first class and the overall production of this film is good . there is even an early appearance from david prowse , who later became the green cross code man and darth vader . the film does have it ' s downsides though , as it is getting pretty routine for the carry - on team to stage historical films and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly . there is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw , who could have helped the film along . however , overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy jokes , so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only , but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyone ' s while to sit down and watch it .", "by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22 - minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered . after all , writer / director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines . the first finds amarillo , texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly - contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction . as olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects . lane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination . all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other ' s protagonist . but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse . lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years . he ' s not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they ' ve got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise . two months earlier , lacrosse ' s own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere . lacrosse knows his killer ' s work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game . it wouldn ' t be fair to reduce everything that ' s wrong with switchback to quaid ' s presence , but it ' s a pretty good place to start . there ' s a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation . we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight - jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he ' s grim because every word comes out in an eastwood - esque rasp . a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film . quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated . it ' s tough to become emotionally invested in a character ' s turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes . even without quaid , it doesn ' t appear that switchback would have stayed on course . the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat . unfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal . once the mystery of the killer ' s identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable . in fact , \" stale and predictable \" describes the direction that switchback takes in general , falling back on far - too - common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere , a climactic fistfight on board a freight train , and edgy law enforcement agents . it ' s too bad stuart wasn ' t willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film . played with atypical restraint by r . lee ermey , he ' s a wonderful , unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions . a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film - maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story - telling . instead , stuart places his trust in a \" name \" star who can ' t carry the material . maybe next time he ' ll throw away that one crucial page in the script , the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story .", "\" the animal \" is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling . it ' s clunky and slow , like watching an 18 - wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill . there are certainly better things you can do with your time . actually , if you ' ve seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments . the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer . but he ' s afflicted with loser - itis . dogs attack him , neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co - workers ignore him . truthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we ' d probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun . this is actually bad because you can ' t like a character if you can ' t develop sympathy for him . we never do , and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor . however , marvin is found by an eccentric doctor ( michael caton ) who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him , implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs . as a result , marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed . he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body , swim with the speed of a dolphin , and can run as fast as a cheetah . imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation . with his enhanced abilities , he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him . however , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn , and instead , marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic , sexual urges . goats beware ! he also chases cats , urinates to mark his territory , or growls at his enemies . what he should ' ve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich . equally tenuous is its other running joke , which involves one of his friends ( guy torry ) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he ' s black . \" it ' s reverse racism , \" he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything . this element doesn ' t work the first time it ' s mentioned , and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence . you don ' t have to be as wise as an owl to realize that \" the animal \" is tame . if there ' s any reason to see this film , it ' s to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut . remember her ? she was voted off in week 11 of the 13 - week program , \" survivor . \" here , she plays marvin ' s sunny love interest . while her role required very little actual acting , she seemed very comfortable ( even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog . . . yuck ! ) . with her adorable disposition , radiant smile , and playful innocence , she could be a meg ryan in the making . it ' s too bad that she ' s in such a mediocre offering", "the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , shape , or form . it ' s been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub - genres , like the prep school sub - genre , the angst - filled teen sub - genre , and the slasher sub - genre . what makes \" peter ' s friends \" so remarkable is not how it doesn ' t follow the rules of this sub - genre , but how it follows it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn ' t mind hanging with . what are the rules of the reunion sub - genre ? well . . . . 1 . you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother . 2 . you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis . 3 . they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart . 4 . the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10 . 5 . they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic . 6 . the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they ' re friends . 7 . there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited . 8 . eightly , they ' re all unhappy or marginally so . 9 . there ' s some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that ' s built up over the years . 10 . the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so . 11 . the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance / song . since it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a \" british ' big chill . ' \" and in some ways it is . both follow the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , big confessionals , and broken relationships . but while \" the big chill \" was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , \" peter ' s friends \" hits its mark , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant . the friends of peter ' s were all in the same theatre group back in ' 82 , performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus ) . after peter ' s ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it . not sure what to do with it immeadiately , he decides to throw a giant reunion party , inviting back all his old chums . of course , all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule . andrew ( kenneth branagh , also directing here ) is an actor who ' s unhappily married to a tv star , carol ( co - writer rita rudner ) . maggie ( emma thompson ) is a successfuly publisher of self - help books , but looks like she needs them more than her customers , as she is lonely and unhappy . roger and mary ( hugh laurie and imelda staunton , who were also married in \" sense and sensibility \" ) are married , and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk , but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died . and sarah ( alphonsia emmanuel ) is as promiscuous as ever , having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian ( tony slattery ) who ' s married and wants a divorce because of her , giving her doubts . as for peter , things seem okay . . . the film features lots of inner - friend jokes , and even some old theatre anecdotes ( which i at least find a lot of fun in , as i ' ve done lots of theatre myself ) . and there are big confessions , brawls between the friends , and by the end , almost everyone is unhappy , even though some have resolved their problems long before the end ( which i kinda dug ) . the final twist would seem forced an anti - climactic , but for some reason , i felt the same way the rest of the friends did . maybe it ' s because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique . that ' s really what makes \" peter ' s friends \" so lovable : the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes , but when someone ' s in crisis , can come together wonderfully for one another . it ' s when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends , and these people are true friends . not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s ( a decade i grew up in , unfortunately ) without taking us outside of the 90s . there are some 80s classics and anti - classics like tears for fears \" everybody wants to rule the world , \" but unfortunately no stupid / fun 80s songs ( i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film , i ' d put some crap go gos song on , or at least some good old \" come on eileen \" ) , but this is the british 80s we ' re talking about . oh well . but anyway , the direction is pretty good , although nothing amazing . branagh ' s forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical , but at least he ' s very good with making a less ambiguous film like this . the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman , with lots of good one - liners , and even some really bad but good puns ( to mock the fact that andrew lives in l . a . , peter , while cutting some logs , asks him is he has wood in l . a . , and andrew says , \" no , but we have hollywood \" - punishment like that ) . the actors , as in most speaking movies , are better than their material , though , with some stand - out performances to the six friends , as well as the outsiders like slattery , rudner , and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter ' s mansion . a little note should be made about hugh laurie ' s performance , as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this - i mean , i ' ve never seen him actually act this dramatically . \" peter ' s friends \" is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion , although i don ' t know what kind i ' ll have ( like most people , i don ' t look forward to my high school reunion ) . because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation , i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that .", "the premise of the new james wong film , final destination , is that alex browning , the protagonist , prevents six of his friends from boarding a doomed airplane , thereby cheating fate . however , fate is not so easily bested , and alex ' s friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances . essentially , this premise is a clever - way to make a slasher - flick without the slasher . unfortunately , this is practically the only clever thing about the film . as far as teen horror flicks go , final destination is better than many . there is enough shocking death , graphic gore , and requisite black humor to provide the essential \" roller coaster \" type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick . unfortunately , this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre . the relationships between the main characters are tenuous and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set - up the next death . the scene where two of the characters break into a funeral home to view the body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary and dramatic but features some of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed . if you are looking for a saturday night thriller to scare your date , this film might do the trick . other than that , wait until it goes into heavy - rotation on cable .", "everybody in this film ' s thinking of alicia . no , this is not a documentary on those of us after we first saw the \" cryin ' \" video . this is one of those erotic thrillers , but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed . first off , there ' s zero sex , almost no nudity , and it ' s not as well - plotted as one of those tweed flicks . well , anyway . the \" plot . \" alicia plays , well , the babysitter , who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents ( j . t . walsh and lee garlington ) go out to a party . the film , trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers , shows every characters ' thoughts , except alicia ' s . the thing is alicia ' s in most of them in most cases , and the thoughts aren ' t too kosher . first off , there ' s her boyfriend ( jeremy london , who gave one of the all - time lousy performances in \" mallrats , \" and is only a notch better here ) , who ' s a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully , played by nicky katt from \" suburbia \" ( who shows he ' s got that quiet creepiness down pat once again ) . they decide they want to crash her babysitting job , looking for the typical babysitting hanky - panky . somethine like that . the film intercuts between the subplots ( alicia babysitting , nicky and jeremy , the party ) and each characters ' thoughts . we get to see jeremy and nicky ' s dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia , j . t . thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub ( she has it all covered up , the little tease ) , and , worst of all , lee garlington dreaming of that hunk , george segal . it even shows them in bed together . yea . i so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed , though i guess i ' m used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in \" flirting with disaster . \" the ending is some kind of big tragedy thing , but come on . like we care about any of the characters . the only interesting one is alicia , mainly because she ' s alicia , and we mostly see her in the fantasies . so i guess she ' s some kind of mystery or something . but she is never explored further . so , basically , this film is just a series of mastabatory images , sometimes featuring a non - nude alicia ( once again , sadly ) , sometimes featuring a scantily - clad george segal ( once again , sadly ) . i watched this on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night , and let me tell you , it is the only way to watch this film . i mean , there ' s a reason they put these kinds of films on late at night : they ' re just as good as sleeping pills . and this one is one big fat waste of time , even for an alicia film .", "the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as ' anywhere but here . ' there isn ' t one thing about this mother - daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest . it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives , as for some reason they couldn ' t figure it out for themselves . if the film looks familiar , that is because \" the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) \" went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with . alvin sargent ' s script was weak and annoyingly claustral . wayne wang ' s ( \" the joy luck club \" ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn ' t convey . pushy mother adele august ( susan sarandon ) forces her 14 - year - old daughter ann ( natalie portman ) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross - country with her to beverly hills . the daughter resents her twice divorced , unstable but exotic , schoolteacher mother , bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life . the daqughter doesn ' t even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can ' t stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio . so it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner . adele ' s dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn ' t look that good , as she lands a job in a slum school , has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids , and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive . daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there . during one of many arguments with her free - spirited mom , they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed , she runs away , only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop ( michael milhoan ) , who offers her wise counsel . with the cop ' s zen wisdom passed onto the daughter , she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla . during their stay in beverly hills , she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer -- a t . s . eliot ( corbin allred ) reader . but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional . when she learns her cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) , who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin , she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn ' t clearly shown why she wants to stay there , and for that matter , it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly . the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams . i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say , is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one , able to recognize mother ' s faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself . mother has a series of setbacks , like being dumped by her dream - boat dentist ( bochner ) she met on the beach , and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part . but mother learns that her daughter has grown - up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her . she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do , is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do . this of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom ' s heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way . this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing .", "jean - luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the crew of the u . s . s . enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960 ' s series , star trek . gone are kirk , spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation . as usual , a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again . this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f . murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist ' s will . it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists . of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong , so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists . insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films . the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group . in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction . it doesn ' t do a bad job , other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line . many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek - fan - only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat . the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense . there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet , why do they have to be moved ? the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f . murray abraham ' s aliens who number only a couple of dozen . so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that ' s plausible . but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever . the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf ( michael dorn ) , the trusty klingon . worf was on star trek : the next generation , so they want to include him in the films . no problem so far . worf is now a character of star trek : deep space nine , so the writers have to find a way to have him show up . in the last star trek movie , first contact , the included worf in a credible fashion , in this one , the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie . what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren ' t hanging on every word on the screen . my minor problems with the movie aside , star trek : insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones . while many of the jokes do miss the mark , many are pretty good , even for non - trekkies . the special effects are among the best for the star trek series . the action is plentiful and well done . this is a very good - looking movie . it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek : the next generation that the acting is first rate . it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade . they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster . most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series . if you ' ve always hated star trek , there is nothing here that is going to change your mind . star trek : insurrection is not the best film in the series , but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones .", "tv ' s buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum in \" simply irresistible . \" sarah michelle gellar , that never - ceasing crusader against never - ending evil every tuesday night on the wb network , here plays a down - on - her - luck chef suspected of dabbling in witchcraft after her flailing restaurant receives help in the form of magically scrumptious meals . taste test results : some vampire slaying , though out of place , would have really livened this excruciating movie up . \" simply irresistible \" is actually quite easy to deny , a disaster of culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on . gellar ' s amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom ( sean patrick flannery of powder ) around the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking , a secret ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the public ' s in her tiny tribeca eatery . all this love and sorcery have a lot to do with the telekinetic crab that also figures into the story , a tale that at times plays like an american spin on 1993 ' s mexican classic \" like water for chocolate . \" several differences : one , \" like water \" didn ' t have a telekinetic crab , and two , \" like water \" was a good film . \" simply irresistible , \" on the other hand , is about as challenging as an easy - bake oven . amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness , from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger - though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish . the intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals , but it ' s not like you ' re were going to miss much . in fact , take away the few instances of salty language and this has made - for - disney channel written all over it . but a majority of \" simply irresistible \" ' s resistibility factor has less to do with the afore - mentioned overkill than the bland leads - tom and amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that there ' s just no fun rooting for their inevitable \" happily ever after . \" nor do the otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense , so we ' re left with a ho - hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs ; it ' s not going to last long , people . perhaps sensing this , the filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like betty buckley , dylan baker and patricia clarkson , but they don ' t go anywhere either . in fact , nothing in \" simply irresistible \" goes anywhere save for gellar , and she doesn ' t go somewhere so much as you wish she ' d go _somewhere_ - like to a better movie . already proving major talent with relatively few big - and small - screen roles , she ' s the sole reason this overcooked souffle isn ' t completely fit for the garbage disposal , looking smashing in her todd oldham - designed duds and investing much more in her perfunctory part than she ever gets in return . it ' s certainly a dish best not served in it ' s current condition , but one can only guess that , without gellar , \" simply irresistible \" would be strictly unwatchable .", "porter stoddard ( warren beatty ) is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie ( diane keaton ) for twenty - five years . they and best friends mona ( goldie hawn ) and griffin ( garry shandling ) are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen , \" town and country . \" \" town and country \" has a pedigree befitting it ' s title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry ( \" the graduate \" ) under the direction of peter chelsom ( \" funny bones \" ) . after years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates , the media has been prepped for beatty ' s next \" ishtar . \" so , is it that bad ? the answer is no . but it ' s not very good either . the major problem with \" town and country \" is that it ' s unstructured and random . stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer , having just bedded a flaky cellist ( nastassja kinski ) . next scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin . then mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings ( buck henry cameos as both couples ' divorce lawyer ) . ellie thinks she ' s overeacting , but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family ' s mississippi manse . the two childhood friends end up in bed together , making us wonder why they ' d never become a couple to begin with . back home , their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter ' s cheating on her . porter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley , idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he ' s gay . the four friends , along with every woman porter ' s dallied with , all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after . although the film begins promisingly , resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps , too many strands drift off into nowhere . the stoddard household is huge , containing two adult children ( josh hartnett , \" the virgin suicides \" and tricia vessey , \" kiss the girls \" ) , their colorful bedmates and a maid who ' s just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home . after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack , the six supporting players are dropped except for an out - of - nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son . porter ' s romantic misadventures with women ( other than mona ) are equally mishandled . once the marital discord begins , the film seems as if it was editted with a machete , stopping and starting , never regaining its rhythm . while beatty gets off a few tart observations , his character is mostly passive and bemused . maybe we ' re supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn ' t initiate his own sex romps ? keaton ' s ellie has a trusting nature that ' s a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character . hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of \" the out of towners \" and \" the first wives ' club \" while shandling ' s relegated to true second banana status . kinski is bland and unmotivated . andie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay ' s most bizarre subplot , which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting , billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic , wheelchair - bound , foul - mouthed mother . heston and seldes are fun , as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party . oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look , but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like \" hear my song \" and \" funny bones . \" the script is this film ' s weakest link - it ' s telling that most of the ( few ) laughs come from old - fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in a bear suit . while \" town and country \" isn ' t exactly painful to sit through , it mostly just lays there .", "the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could ' ve been effective . such is the case with _urban legend_ , the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks . the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends . examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house . the killer wears one of those l . l . bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up , so you can ' t see the face . i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days . anyhow , the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric . it ' s a very good setup that promises more chills to come . unfortunately , the film never takes off from there . the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus . like most slasher flicks , this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac ( or in this case an axe wielding maniac ) . i ' ve always wondered why these killers don ' t save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill . after the fine first scene , the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you - thought - it - was - the - killer - but - was - just - someone - else scares . these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music . i guess sudden , sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days . the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast . the slasher appears , attacks , the victim is eviscerated , and the tedious cycle appears anew . false scares should always be used in moderation . someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren ' t as scary as they used to be . this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit -- it ' s not frightening . remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ ? this movie still adheres to them . tons of illogical moments about ; more than i really have the inclination to list . and i don ' t mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense . that type of illogical can be fun . this film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember . the last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you ' ll be laughing more than you ' ll be screaming . actually , you won ' t be screaming at all . at its best , the acting can barely be called \" adequate \" and the script could ' ve definitely used a rewrite or two . the film still manages to have some strong points . the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans . there are some intentionally funny moments . ( these were exceeded by the unintentional ones . ) the film is well made from a technical standpoint . besides the first part , there is also another good scene , a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station . if there had only been more sequences like this , that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music , _urban legend_ might ' ve been worth your money .", "i know that \" funnest \" isn ' t a word . \" fun \" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . but that ' s the word that came to me right after viewing \" chicken run . \" no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like \" that was the funnest movie i ' ve ever seen ! \" so to hell with webster ' s -- \" chicken run \" is one of the funnest movies i ' ve seen in a while . i can ' t remember the last time i ' ve seen anything funner . the chickens at tweedy ' s farm are up to something . living in a concentration camp - like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm ' s egg - selling plan for a pie - selling plan . she orders a huge pie - making machine , cackling , \" chickens go in ; pies come out . \" what sort of pies ? chicken pies , of course . co - director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar - winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . part of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park ' s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . now teaming with co - director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" the plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball - bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg - inspired action sequences providing the excitement . thing is , the film doesn ' t feel like it ' s been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners - of - war movie starring chickens ? park and lord milk the incongruity for all it ' s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . but they ' re * chickens * , so it ' s funny to us . another thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park ' s films ) succeed is the animators ' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they ' re cribbing . there are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" there ' s even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light - hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson ' s nationality and film history . the \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . consider this : since july of last year , i ' ve seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . why ? because once you got past the thought that \" they ' re parodying that &# 8216 ; blair witch ' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . conversely , \" chicken run \" doesn ' t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . if you ' ve never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it ' s understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . enjoyment of this movie doesn ' t require knowledge of film history , but if you ' ve got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it ' s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung - ho veneer . the characters ' inevitable romance doesn ' t feel contrived , but sweet . poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn ' t any help . jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one - liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply - trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing - dancing sequence . they even come up with an inspired riff on something that ' s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . the animation is first - rate . remember that this was all done the old - fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios ' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . as in such top - notch family fare as \" a bug ' s life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they ' ll catch all the details . anyway , the movie ' s just a boatload of fun . funnest damn movie i ' ve seen all year .", "a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge . at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic -- and , yes , ordinary -- premise . after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville ' s ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom . the joke here is that celine is a willing victim -- her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge -- and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . . . and , ultimately ( didn ' t we see this one coming ? ) , love . so far , so mediocre . but mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge ' s contextual frame for the romance . it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven ' s police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o ' reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert -- or lose their angel status . this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture . but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand . not that there is much of a romance to begin with . try as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one - note to become very endearing characters . celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard . as such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two -- then again , they never seem to really connect with each other . when celine and robert start to overtly act on their \" feelings , \" it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural . but i am not exactly sure if boyle and company ' s point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish . boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that -- energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting . the cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling . and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic -- in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue . watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool . instead , the film just gives quirky a bad name . my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing \" beyond the sea \" at a karaoke bar . after a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter . the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport . alas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end . i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill . a life less ordinary certainly delivers something \" different , \" but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary . \" i can accept failure . everyone fails at something . but i can ' t accept not trying . it doesn ' t matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart . \" -- michael jordan", "this has some major spoilers for the film , so be forwarned . the won ' t appear till later in the article , so you ' re safe for now . eyes wide shot ( 1999 ) running time : 2 hours 39 minutes 2 . 35 : 1 theatrical aspect starring : tom cruise ( dr . bill hardford ) , nicole kidman ( alice hardford ) , sidney pollack , leelee sobieski , todd field ( nick nightingale ) directed , co - written , produced by : stanley kubrick inspired by : \" traumnovelle \" by : arthur schnitzer this is an interesting film . i must first off state , that you musn ' t believe any of the rumors of the film . cruise is not a cross dresser , kidman doesn ' t shoot heroin , and there ' s not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist . the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written . the translation , \" dream novel , \" makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film . there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film . rather than complain about it as some may and already have , see it as a style of shooting . i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could . this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly . as an auteur and stickler for details , kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one . the film looks great , but there are a good deal of bloopers / flubs that occur . you see lots of boom shots ( in reflection ) and you see the camera at least twice . 16 months for this ? wow . reflection is the biggest killer for this film . their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly . one more topic of heated discussion : i saw the \" austin powers \" version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you ' ll probably not see them . two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it ' s supposed to be . spoilers below : the film itself starts with ( cruise ) bill and ( kidman ) alice getting ready for a little x - mas soiree . they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment , which is actually an apartment owned by pollack . bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party ' s entertainment . soon after , bill and alice are flirting with others at the party , thinking that the other has not noticed . bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time . the next day , bill and alice , casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations . they both discover that they both knew about the flirting . bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship , and gets alice extremely angry . in her hazy state , she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill , not caring about the possible aftereffects . bill gets called away when one of his patients dies , and goes to console his daughter . when his patient ' s engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection , he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife , alice and a naval officer . he sees \" opportunity \" as a betrayal to his wife , and before they can continue , they are interrupted . as he strolls home , he encounters a hooker . seeing another \" opportunity \" arise , he follows the hooker home . they toy around , but before the act ensues , alice calls his cell phone . he breaks the date with the hooker , and heads back out into the night . he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing , so he heads in . when he meets the friend , the friend reveals that for extra scratch , he plays these strange parties , while blindfolded . bill is intrigued and wants to go to one . nick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password . what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl , leelee sobieski , and her father . the young girl has drawn his eye , but her young age , and the prescence of her father deter this from happening . he gets to the party , which is to say the least , a strange affair . after partaking in some strange \" religious \" right , women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies . a woman warns bill in disguise , that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party . he is detained after a second warning , where he is outed for not being in the group . after getting home , he hides the evidence of his evenings events . unable to carry on in his day , he tries piece the events of the previous night together . in the process , he finds that nick has disappeared , his life is possibly in danger , and the woman that warned him has died . i ' m trying to save a bit of the film here , it ' s worth sitting through to get to this point . this is only about 100 minutes at this point . this is a strange film , because despite the events that occur , the film has a strong family message behind it . it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film . it ' s got sex in it , it has nudity , drugs , and many more immoralistic values . but they all serve to show why they are bad in one ' s life . i recommend this film highly on many merits . cruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene , and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself ."]
