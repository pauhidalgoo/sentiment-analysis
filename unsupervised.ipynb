' and diaz adds some brightness to this film as a wedding - needing fiancee . but her talents are essentially wasted here . it ' s obvious that the film maker is trying to strike a certain tone . but the way that he chooses to do it is tasteless . do not make a very bad decision by seeing this film \"\n",
